00:00:06 - 00:00:09
Okay, hold on, don't shoot. 

00:00:10 - 00:00:11
You see where you're going?
Mm-hmm.

00:00:12 - 00:00:13
Okay. 

00:00:13 - 00:00:15
Now, let's worry about how you get there. 

00:00:16 - 00:00:17
Gotta move your foot here. 

00:00:17 - 00:00:19
Point your toe this way. 

00:00:19 - 00:00:21
Your hips here. 

00:00:21 - 00:00:22
Okay? 

00:00:23 - 00:00:24
Can you see?
Yeah.

00:00:25 - 00:00:26
Are you sure?
Mm-hmm.

00:00:26 - 00:00:27
How about now? Can you see now? 

00:00:27 - 00:00:29
No.
How about now?

00:00:31 - 00:00:32
All right. 

00:00:32 - 00:00:34
Ready? Three fingers. 

00:00:35 - 00:00:36
Nice! 

00:00:38 - 00:00:39
Nice throw, kiddo. 

00:00:40 - 00:00:41
Here you go. 

00:00:41 - 00:00:43
Hey, you guys want mayo? Or mustard? 

00:00:43 - 00:00:45
Or both? 

00:00:45 - 00:00:47
Who puts mayo on a hot dog? 

00:00:47 - 00:00:48
Probably your brothers. 

00:00:48 - 00:00:50
Two mustard, please! Thanks, Mama. 

00:00:51 - 00:00:52
Got it! 

00:00:52 - 00:00:54
Nate, mayo or mustard? 

00:00:54 - 00:00:55
How about ketchup? 

00:00:56 - 00:00:58
Or ketchup. I got ketchup, too. 

00:00:58 - 00:00:59
Mind your elbow. 

00:01:02 - 00:01:03
Good job, hawk-eye. 

00:01:03 - 00:01:05
Go get your arrow. 

00:01:08 - 00:01:09
Hey, guys! 

00:01:09 - 00:01:12
Enough practice. Soup's on! 

00:01:12 - 00:01:13
All right. 

00:01:13 - 00:01:14
We're coming. We're hungry. 

00:01:15 - 00:01:17
Lila, let's go. 

00:01:20 - 00:01:21
Lila? 

00:01:24 - 00:01:25
Honey? 

00:01:29 - 00:01:30
Hey, babe? 

00:01:40 - 00:01:41
Babe? 

00:01:43 - 00:01:44
Babe? 

00:01:46 - 00:01:47
Boys! 

00:01:49 - 00:01:50
Boys! 

00:01:52 - 00:01:53
Laura! 

00:02:37 - 00:02:38
You don't need to do that. 

00:02:39 - 00:02:42
Because you're just holding the position. 

00:02:43 - 00:02:44
Oh, yeah. 

00:02:44 - 00:02:45
That was close. 

00:02:47 - 00:02:49
That's a goal. We are now one apiece. 

00:02:49 - 00:02:50
I would like to try again. 

00:02:53 - 00:02:55
We're tied up. Feel the tension? 

00:02:55 - 00:02:57
It's fun. 

00:02:57 - 00:02:59
That was terrible. Now you have a chance to win. 

00:03:00 - 00:03:01
And you've won. 

00:03:02 - 00:03:03
Congratulations. 

00:03:04 - 00:03:05
Fair game. 

00:03:06 - 00:03:07
Good sport. 

00:03:08 - 00:03:10
You have fun? 

00:03:12 - 00:03:14
It was fun. 

00:03:36 - 00:03:38
This thing on? 

00:03:40 - 00:03:42
Hey, Miss Potts. Pep. 

00:03:44 - 00:03:46
If you find this recording... 

00:03:46 - 00:03:49
don't post it on social media. 

00:03:49 - 00:03:51
It's gonna be a real tearjerker. 

00:03:51 - 00:03:54
I don't know if you're ever gonna see these. 

00:03:54 - 00:03:56
I don't even know if you're still... 

00:03:56 - 00:03:58
Oh, God, I hope so. 

00:03:59 - 00:04:01
Today's day 21. 

00:04:02 - 00:04:04
No, 22. 

00:04:05 - 00:04:07
You know, if it wasn't for the existential terror... 

00:04:07 - 00:04:12
of staring into the literal void of space, I'd say I'm feeling a little better today. 

00:04:12 - 00:04:15
Infection's run its course, thanks to the Blue Meanie back there. 

00:04:16 - 00:04:17
You'd love her. 

00:04:17 - 00:04:19
Very practical. 

00:04:19 - 00:04:21
Only a tiny bit sadistic. 

00:04:26 - 00:04:28
So, the fuel cells were cracked during battle... 

00:04:28 - 00:04:31
and we figured out a way to reverse the ion charge... 

00:04:31 - 00:04:34
and bought ourselves about 48 hours of flight time. 

00:04:37 - 00:04:39
But it's now dead in the water. 

00:04:39 - 00:04:42
Thousand light years from the nearest 7-Eleven. 

00:04:44 - 00:04:46
Oxygen will run out tomorrow morning... 

00:04:48 - 00:04:49
and that'll be it. 

00:04:53 - 00:04:56
Pep, I know I said no more surprises... 

00:04:56 - 00:05:00
but I got to say I was really hoping to pull off one last one. 

00:05:00 - 00:05:02
But it looks like... 

00:05:02 - 00:05:04
Well, you know what it looks like. 

00:05:05 - 00:05:07
Don't feel bad about this. 

00:05:07 - 00:05:10
I mean, actually, if you grovel for a couple weeks... 

00:05:11 - 00:05:14
and then move on with enormous guilt... 

00:05:19 - 00:05:23
I should probably lie down for a minute. Go rest my eyes. 

00:05:26 - 00:05:27
Please know... 

00:05:29 - 00:05:32
when I drift off, it'll be like every night lately. 

00:05:32 - 00:05:35
I'm fine. Totally fine. 

00:05:36 - 00:05:37
I dream about you. 

00:05:39 - 00:05:41
Because it's always you. 

00:09:03 - 00:09:04
Couldn't stop him. 

00:09:04 - 00:09:05
Neither could I. 

00:09:06 - 00:09:07
Hang on. 

00:09:09 - 00:09:11
I lost the kid. 

00:09:13 - 00:09:15
Tony, we lost. 

00:09:17 - 00:09:18
Is...? 

00:09:19 - 00:09:21
Oh, good.
Oh, my God!

00:09:22 - 00:09:23
Oh, my God! 

00:09:28 - 00:09:30
It's okay. 

00:09:36 - 00:09:39
It's been 23 days since Thanos came to Earth. 

00:09:41 - 00:09:43
World governments are in pieces. 

00:09:44 - 00:09:46
The parts that are still working... 

00:09:46 - 00:09:49
are trying to take a census and it looks like he did... 

00:09:52 - 00:09:54
He did exactly what he said he was gonna do. 

00:09:54 - 00:09:55
Thanos wiped out... 

00:09:58 - 00:10:01
50% of all living creatures. 

00:10:05 - 00:10:07
Where is he now? Where? 

00:10:07 - 00:10:09
We don't know. 

00:10:09 - 00:10:12
He just opened a portal and walked through. 

00:10:15 - 00:10:16
What's wrong with him? 

00:10:17 - 00:10:19
He's pissed. 

00:10:19 - 00:10:20
He thinks he failed. 

00:10:22 - 00:10:23
Which, of course, he did... 

00:10:23 - 00:10:25
but there's a lot of that going around, ain't there? 

00:10:25 - 00:10:28
Honestly, until this exact second I thought you were a Build-A-Bear. 

00:10:28 - 00:10:29
Maybe I am. 

00:10:29 - 00:10:31
We've been hunting Thanos for three weeks now. 

00:10:31 - 00:10:33
Deep space scans... 

00:10:33 - 00:10:35
and satellites, and we got nothing. 

00:10:37 - 00:10:38
Tony, you fought him. 

00:10:38 - 00:10:39
Who told you that? 

00:10:40 - 00:10:41
I didn't fight him. 

00:10:41 - 00:10:43
No, he wiped my face with a planet... 

00:10:43 - 00:10:45
while the Bleecker Street magician gave away the store. 

00:10:45 - 00:10:48
That's what happened. There was no fight, 'cause he's not beatable. 

00:10:48 - 00:10:51
Did he give you any clues, any coordinates, anything? 

00:10:54 - 00:10:55
I saw this coming a few years back. 

00:10:55 - 00:10:57
I had a vision. I didn't wanna believe it. 

00:10:57 - 00:10:59
Thought I was dreaming. 

00:10:59 - 00:11:00
Tony, I'm gonna need you to focus. 

00:11:00 - 00:11:02
And I needed you. 

00:11:02 - 00:11:03
As in, past tense. 

00:11:03 - 00:11:07
That trumps what you need. It's too late, buddy. 

00:11:07 - 00:11:08
Sorry. 

00:11:09 - 00:11:11
You know what I need? I need a shave. 

00:11:12 - 00:11:15
And I believe I remember telling all youse... 

00:11:15 - 00:11:16
Tony, Tony! 

00:11:16 - 00:11:21
Alive and otherwise, that what we needed was a suit of armor around the world. 

00:11:21 - 00:11:25
Remember that? Whether it impacted our precious freedoms or not. 

00:11:25 - 00:11:26
That's what we needed. 

00:11:26 - 00:11:28
Well, that didn't work out, did it? 

00:11:28 - 00:11:29
I said we'd lose. 

00:11:29 - 00:11:31
You said, "We'll do that together, too." 

00:11:32 - 00:11:33
And guess what, Cap? 

00:11:33 - 00:11:35
We lost. 

00:11:35 - 00:11:36
And you weren't there. 

00:11:38 - 00:11:39
But that's what we do, right? 

00:11:39 - 00:11:42
Our best work after the fact? We're the "Avengers." 

00:11:42 - 00:11:44
We're the "Avengers," not the "Pre-vengers." 

00:11:44 - 00:11:45
Okay.
Right?

00:11:45 - 00:11:47
You made your point. Just sit down, okay? 

00:11:47 - 00:11:48
Okay. No, no, here's my point. You know what? 

00:11:48 - 00:11:49
She's great by the way.
Tony, you're sick. Sit down.

00:11:49 - 00:11:51
We need you. You're new blood. 

00:11:51 - 00:11:54
Bunch of tired old mules. I got nothing for you, Cap. 

00:11:54 - 00:11:55
I got no coordinates... 

00:11:55 - 00:11:58
no clues, no strategies, no options. 

00:11:58 - 00:12:00
Zero. Zip. Nada. 

00:12:00 - 00:12:02
No trust, liar. 

00:12:07 - 00:12:08
Here, take this. 

00:12:08 - 00:12:10
You find him, you put that on... 

00:12:11 - 00:12:12
you hide. 

00:12:13 - 00:12:15
Tony!
I'm fine.

00:12:15 - 00:12:17
Let me... 

00:12:23 - 00:12:25
Bruce gave him a sedative. 

00:12:25 - 00:12:27
He's gonna probably be out for the rest of the day. 

00:12:28 - 00:12:29
You guys take care of him... 

00:12:29 - 00:12:31
and I'll bring him a Xorrian elixir when I come back. 

00:12:32 - 00:12:33
Where are you going? 

00:12:33 - 00:12:34
To kill Thanos. 

00:12:37 - 00:12:39
Hey. 

00:12:39 - 00:12:41
You know, we usually work as a team here... 

00:12:41 - 00:12:43
and, between you and I, morale's a little fragile. 

00:12:43 - 00:12:46
We realize up there is more your territory, but this is our fight, too. 

00:12:47 - 00:12:48
You even know where he is? 

00:12:48 - 00:12:49
I know people who might. 

00:12:49 - 00:12:51
Don't bother. 

00:12:52 - 00:12:53
I can tell you where Thanos is. 

00:12:56 - 00:12:59
Thanos spent a long time trying to perfect me. 

00:12:59 - 00:13:03
And when he worked, he talked about his Great Plan. 

00:13:04 - 00:13:07
Even disassembled, I wanted to please him. 

00:13:07 - 00:13:08
I'd ask... 

00:13:09 - 00:13:12
where would we go once his plan was complete? 

00:13:12 - 00:13:14
And his answer was always the same. 

00:13:18 - 00:13:19
"To the Garden." 

00:13:20 - 00:13:23
That's cute. Thanos has a retirement plan. 

00:13:23 - 00:13:24
So, where is he? 

00:13:25 - 00:13:27
When Thanos snapped his fingers... 

00:13:27 - 00:13:31
Earth became ground zero for a power surge of ridiculously cosmic proportions. 

00:13:31 - 00:13:33
No one's ever seen anything like it. 

00:13:33 - 00:13:35
Until two days ago... 

00:13:36 - 00:13:38
on this planet. 

00:13:39 - 00:13:40
Thanos is there. 

00:13:42 - 00:13:44
He used the stones again. 

00:13:44 - 00:13:45
Hey, hey, hey. 

00:13:46 - 00:13:48
We'd be going in shorthanded, you know? 

00:13:48 - 00:13:49
Look, he's still got the stones, so... 

00:13:49 - 00:13:51
So, let's get 'em. 

00:13:51 - 00:13:53
Use them to bring everyone back. 

00:13:53 - 00:13:54
Just like that? 

00:13:54 - 00:13:56
Yeah. Just like that. 

00:13:56 - 00:13:59
Even if there's a small chance that we can undo this... 

00:13:59 - 00:14:02
I mean, we owe it to everyone who's not in this room to try. 

00:14:02 - 00:14:06
If we do this, how do we know it's gonna end any differently than it did before? 

00:14:06 - 00:14:08
Because before you didn't have me. 

00:14:09 - 00:14:10
Hey, new girl? 

00:14:10 - 00:14:13
Everybody in this room is about that superhero life. 

00:14:13 - 00:14:16
And if you don't mind my asking, where the hell have you been all this time? 

00:14:16 - 00:14:18
There are a lot of other planets in the universe. 

00:14:18 - 00:14:21
And unfortunately, they didn't have you guys. 

00:14:41 - 00:14:43
I like this one. 

00:14:47 - 00:14:50
Let's go get this son of a bitch. 

00:15:12 - 00:15:13
Okay. 

00:15:13 - 00:15:15
Who here hasn't been to space? 

00:15:17 - 00:15:18
Why? 

00:15:18 - 00:15:20
You better not throw up on my ship. 

00:15:20 - 00:15:21
Approaching jump in three... 

00:15:22 - 00:15:23
two, one. 

00:15:37 - 00:15:39
I'll head down for recon. 

00:15:57 - 00:15:58
This is gonna work, Steve. 

00:15:59 - 00:16:00
I know it will. 

00:16:04 - 00:16:06
'Cause I don't know what I'm gonna do if it doesn't. 

00:16:07 - 00:16:11
No satellites. No ships. No armies. 

00:16:11 - 00:16:12
No ground defenses of any kind. 

00:16:14 - 00:16:16
It's just him. 

00:16:17 - 00:16:18
And that's enough. 

00:17:48 - 00:17:49
Oh, no. 

00:17:59 - 00:18:00
Where are they? 

00:18:00 - 00:18:02
Answer the question. 

00:18:04 - 00:18:07
The universe required correction. 

00:18:07 - 00:18:11
After that, the stones served no purpose... 

00:18:11 - 00:18:12
beyond temptation. 

00:18:13 - 00:18:15
You murdered trillions! 

00:18:16 - 00:18:17
You should be grateful. 

00:18:21 - 00:18:23
Where are the stones? 

00:18:23 - 00:18:25
Gone. 

00:18:25 - 00:18:26
Reduced to atoms. 

00:18:27 - 00:18:28
You used them two days ago! 

00:18:28 - 00:18:32
I used the stones to destroy the stones. 

00:18:32 - 00:18:34
It nearly killed me. 

00:18:35 - 00:18:37
But the work is done. 

00:18:38 - 00:18:40
It always will be. 

00:18:42 - 00:18:45
I am inevitable. 

00:18:48 - 00:18:50
We have to tear this place apart. He has to be lying! 

00:18:50 - 00:18:51
My father is many things. 

00:18:52 - 00:18:54
A liar is not one of them. 

00:18:58 - 00:19:00
Thank you, daughter. 

00:19:02 - 00:19:04
Perhaps I treated you too harshly. 

00:19:11 - 00:19:12
What? 

00:19:13 - 00:19:14
What did you do? 

00:19:16 - 00:19:18
I went for the head. 

00:20:29 - 00:20:31
So... 

00:20:32 - 00:20:34
I went on a date the other day. 

00:20:35 - 00:20:36
It's the first time in five years. 

00:20:36 - 00:20:39
You know? I'm sitting there at dinner. 

00:20:40 - 00:20:42
I didn't even know what to talk about. 

00:20:43 - 00:20:45
What did you talk about? 

00:20:45 - 00:20:48
Same old crap. You know, how things have changed. 

00:20:49 - 00:20:51
My job, his job. 

00:20:52 - 00:20:54
How much we miss the Mets. 

00:20:56 - 00:20:58
And then things got quiet... 

00:21:00 - 00:21:03
then he cried as they were serving the salads. 

00:21:03 - 00:21:05
What about you? 

00:21:06 - 00:21:09
I cried just before dessert. 

00:21:13 - 00:21:15
But I'm seeing him again tomorrow, so... 

00:21:16 - 00:21:17
That's great. 

00:21:17 - 00:21:19
You did the hardest part. You took the jump. 

00:21:19 - 00:21:21
You didn't know where you were gonna come down. 

00:21:22 - 00:21:26
And that's it. That's those little brave baby steps we got to take... 

00:21:26 - 00:21:30
to try and become whole again, try and find purpose. 

00:21:32 - 00:21:36
I went in the ice in '45, right after I met the love of my life. 

00:21:37 - 00:21:38
Woke up 70 years later. 

00:21:41 - 00:21:44
You got to move on. 

00:21:46 - 00:21:48
Gotta move on. 

00:21:53 - 00:21:55
The world is in our hands. 

00:21:55 - 00:21:57
It's left to us, guys. 

00:21:58 - 00:22:00
And we got to do something with it. 

00:22:00 - 00:22:02
Otherwise... 

00:22:03 - 00:22:05
Thanos should've killed all of us. 

00:23:07 - 00:23:09
What the hell? 

00:23:21 - 00:23:22
Hope? 

00:23:56 - 00:23:57
Kid! 

00:23:57 - 00:23:58
Hey, kid! 

00:24:02 - 00:24:04
What the hell happened here? 

00:24:36 - 00:24:38
Oh, my God! 

00:24:41 - 00:24:42
Oh, please! 

00:24:42 - 00:24:44
Please, please! 

00:24:44 - 00:24:46
No, no, no. No. 

00:24:47 - 00:24:49
No. 

00:24:51 - 00:24:52
Excuse me. Sorry. 

00:24:52 - 00:24:54
Cassie, no. 

00:24:54 - 00:24:55
No, no, no. 

00:24:57 - 00:24:58
No, no. 

00:24:59 - 00:25:02
Please, please, please. No, Cassie. 

00:25:09 - 00:25:11
What? 

00:25:41 - 00:25:42
Cassie? 

00:25:43 - 00:25:45
Dad? 

00:26:11 - 00:26:12
You're so big! 

00:26:26 - 00:26:31
Yeah. We boarded that highly-suspect warship Danvers pinged. 

00:26:31 - 00:26:33
It was an infectious garbage scow. 

00:26:33 - 00:26:34
So, thanks for the hot tip. 

00:26:34 - 00:26:36
Well, you were closer. 

00:26:36 - 00:26:37
Yeah. And now we smell like garbage. 

00:26:37 - 00:26:39
You get a reading on those tremors? 

00:26:39 - 00:26:41
'Twas a mild subduction under the African plate. 

00:26:42 - 00:26:44
Do we have a visual? How are we handling it? 

00:26:44 - 00:26:45
Nat. 

00:26:45 - 00:26:47
It's an earthquake under the ocean. 

00:26:48 - 00:26:50
We handle it by not handling it. 

00:26:51 - 00:26:53
Carol, are we seeing you here next month? 

00:26:54 - 00:26:56
Not likely.
What? You gonna get another haircut?

00:26:57 - 00:26:58
Listen, fur face. 

00:26:58 - 00:27:00
I'm covering a lot of territory. 

00:27:00 - 00:27:03
The things that are happening on Earth are happening everywhere. 

00:27:04 - 00:27:05
On thousands of planets. 

00:27:06 - 00:27:08
All right, all right. That's a good point. That's a good point. 

00:27:08 - 00:27:11
So, you might not see me for a long time. 

00:27:11 - 00:27:13
All right. Well... 

00:27:14 - 00:27:16
This channel's always active. 

00:27:16 - 00:27:18
So, if anything goes sideways... 

00:27:18 - 00:27:21
anyone's making trouble where they shouldn't... 

00:27:21 - 00:27:22
comes through me. 

00:27:23 - 00:27:24
Okay. 

00:27:24 - 00:27:25
All right. 

00:27:26 - 00:27:27
Good luck. 

00:27:36 - 00:27:37
Where are you? 

00:27:37 - 00:27:38
Mexico. 

00:27:38 - 00:27:41
The Federales found a room full of bodies. 

00:27:41 - 00:27:43
Looks like a bunch of cartel guys... 

00:27:43 - 00:27:45
never even had a chance to get their guns off. 

00:27:45 - 00:27:47
It's probably a rival gang. 

00:27:47 - 00:27:48
Except it isn't. 

00:27:48 - 00:27:50
It's definitely Barton. 

00:27:51 - 00:27:53
What he's done here... 

00:27:53 - 00:27:56
what he's been doing for the last few years... 

00:27:57 - 00:27:58
I mean, the scene that he left... 

00:27:59 - 00:28:03
I got to tell you, there's a part of me that doesn't even wanna find him. 

00:28:09 - 00:28:11
Will you find out where he's going next? 

00:28:15 - 00:28:16
Nat? 

00:28:18 - 00:28:19
Please? 

00:28:21 - 00:28:22
Okay. 

00:28:31 - 00:28:33
You know, I'd offer to cook you dinner... 

00:28:33 - 00:28:35
but you seem pretty miserable already. 

00:28:39 - 00:28:40
You here to do your laundry? 

00:28:41 - 00:28:42
And to see a friend. 

00:28:43 - 00:28:46
Clearly, your friend is fine. 

00:28:49 - 00:28:51
You know, I saw a pod of whales when I was coming over the bridge. 

00:28:51 - 00:28:53
In the Hudson?
There's fewer ships...

00:28:53 - 00:28:55
cleaner water. 

00:28:55 - 00:28:59
You know, if you're about to tell me to look on the bright side... 

00:29:01 - 00:29:05
I'm about to hit you in the head with a peanut butter sandwich. 

00:29:07 - 00:29:08
Sorry. 

00:29:08 - 00:29:09
Force of habit. 

00:29:23 - 00:29:26
You know, I keep telling everybody they should move on... 

00:29:27 - 00:29:28
and grow. 

00:29:30 - 00:29:31
Some do. 

00:29:34 - 00:29:36
But not us. 

00:29:37 - 00:29:39
If I move on, who does this? 

00:29:39 - 00:29:41
Maybe it doesn't need to be done. 

00:29:45 - 00:29:48
I used to have nothing. 

00:29:49 - 00:29:51
And then I got this. 

00:29:53 - 00:29:55
This job. 

00:29:57 - 00:29:59
This family. 

00:30:05 - 00:30:06
And I was better because of it. 

00:30:13 - 00:30:16
And even though they're gone... 

00:30:20 - 00:30:23
I'm still trying to be better. 

00:30:26 - 00:30:28
I think we both need to get a life. 

00:30:30 - 00:30:32
You first. 

00:30:37 - 00:30:40
Hi, hi! Is anyone home? 

00:30:40 - 00:30:42
This is Scott Lang. 

00:30:42 - 00:30:45
We met a few years ago at the airport... 

00:30:45 - 00:30:47
in Germany? 

00:30:47 - 00:30:49
I was the guy that got really big. I had a mask on. 

00:30:49 - 00:30:51
You wouldn't recognize me.
Is this an old message?

00:30:51 - 00:30:54
Ant-Man? I know you know that. 

00:30:54 - 00:30:57
It's the front gate.
I really need to talk to you guys.

00:31:03 - 00:31:04
Scott. 

00:31:05 - 00:31:06
Are you okay? 

00:31:06 - 00:31:07
Yeah. 

00:31:09 - 00:31:11
Have either of you guys ever studied quantum physics? 

00:31:12 - 00:31:13
Only to make conversation. 

00:31:14 - 00:31:16
All right, so... 

00:31:16 - 00:31:19
five years ago, right before... 

00:31:20 - 00:31:21
Thanos... 

00:31:21 - 00:31:23
I was in a place called the quantum realm. 

00:31:23 - 00:31:26
The quantum realm is like its own microscopic universe. 

00:31:26 - 00:31:28
To get in there, you have to be incredibly small. 

00:31:28 - 00:31:30
Hope. She's my... 

00:31:32 - 00:31:34
She was my... 

00:31:35 - 00:31:37
She was supposed to pull me out. 

00:31:37 - 00:31:38
And then Thanos happened... 

00:31:38 - 00:31:40
and I got stuck in there. 

00:31:41 - 00:31:43
I'm sorry, that must have been a very long five years. 

00:31:43 - 00:31:44
Yeah, but that's just it. 

00:31:44 - 00:31:45
It wasn't. 

00:31:46 - 00:31:47
For me, it was five hours. 

00:31:47 - 00:31:50
See, the rules of the quantum realm aren't like they are up here. 

00:31:50 - 00:31:51
Everything is unpredictable. 

00:31:51 - 00:31:52
Is that anybody's sandwich? 

00:31:53 - 00:31:54
I'm starving. 

00:31:54 - 00:31:55
Scott. 

00:31:55 - 00:31:57
What are you talking about? 

00:31:58 - 00:31:59
So... 

00:32:00 - 00:32:02
what I'm saying is... 

00:32:02 - 00:32:05
time works differently in the quantum realm. 

00:32:05 - 00:32:08
The only problem is right now we don't have a way to navigate it. 

00:32:09 - 00:32:10
But what if we did? 

00:32:10 - 00:32:13
I can't stop thinking about it. What if we could somehow control the chaos... 

00:32:14 - 00:32:15
and we could navigate it? 

00:32:15 - 00:32:16
What if there was a way... 

00:32:17 - 00:32:19
that we could enter the quantum realm at a certain point in time... 

00:32:20 - 00:32:22
but then exit the quantum realm at another point in time? 

00:32:22 - 00:32:24
Like... 

00:32:25 - 00:32:27
Like before Thanos.
Wait.

00:32:27 - 00:32:28
Are you talking about a time machine? 

00:32:29 - 00:32:31
No. No, of course not. No, not a time machine. 

00:32:31 - 00:32:32
This is more like a... 

00:32:35 - 00:32:36
Yeah. Like a time machine. 

00:32:37 - 00:32:38
I know, it's crazy. It's crazy. 

00:32:39 - 00:32:42
But I can't stop thinking about it. There's got to be... 

00:32:43 - 00:32:44
some way... 

00:32:44 - 00:32:46
It's crazy.
Scott.

00:32:46 - 00:32:47
I get emails from a raccoon... 

00:32:48 - 00:32:50
so nothing sounds crazy anymore. 

00:32:50 - 00:32:52
So, who do we talk to about this? 

00:33:11 - 00:33:12
Chow time! 

00:33:14 - 00:33:15
Maguna. 

00:33:20 - 00:33:21
Morgan H. Stark, you want some lunch? 

00:33:22 - 00:33:24
Define "lunch" or be disintegrated.
Okay.

00:33:26 - 00:33:27
You should not be wearing that, okay? 

00:33:27 - 00:33:30
That is part of a special anniversary gift I'm making for Mom. 

00:33:34 - 00:33:36
There you go. You thinking about lunch? 

00:33:36 - 00:33:38
I can give you a handful of crickets on a bed of lettuce. 

00:33:38 - 00:33:40
No.
That's what you want.

00:33:40 - 00:33:42
How did you find this? 

00:33:43 - 00:33:44
Garage.
Really?

00:33:45 - 00:33:47
Were you looking for it?
No.

00:33:47 - 00:33:49
I found it, though. 

00:33:50 - 00:33:51
You like going in the garage, huh? 

00:33:51 - 00:33:53
So does Daddy. 

00:33:53 - 00:33:56
It's fine, actually. Mom never wears anything I buy her. 

00:33:59 - 00:34:00
So, I'm gonna... 

00:34:18 - 00:34:20
No. We know what it sounds like. 

00:34:20 - 00:34:22
Tony, after everything you've seen, is anything really impossible? 

00:34:22 - 00:34:25
Quantum fluctuation messes with the Planck Scale... 

00:34:25 - 00:34:28
which then triggers the Deutsch Proposition. Can we agree on that? 

00:34:28 - 00:34:29
Thank you. 

00:34:29 - 00:34:31
In layman's terms, it means you're not coming home. 

00:34:32 - 00:34:33
I did.
No.

00:34:33 - 00:34:34
You accidentally survived. 

00:34:35 - 00:34:37
It's a billion-to-one cosmic fluke. 

00:34:37 - 00:34:40
And now you wanna pull a... What do you call it? 

00:34:42 - 00:34:44
A time heist? 

00:34:44 - 00:34:47
Yeah, a time heist. Of course. Why didn't we think of this before? 

00:34:48 - 00:34:50
Oh, because it's laughable. Because it's a pipe dream. 

00:34:50 - 00:34:54
The stones are in the past. We could go back, we could get them. 

00:34:54 - 00:34:56
We can snap our own fingers. We can bring everybody back. 

00:34:56 - 00:34:58
Or screw it up worse than he already has, right? 

00:34:58 - 00:34:59
I don't believe we would. 

00:35:00 - 00:35:03
Gotta say it. I sometimes miss that giddy optimism. 

00:35:03 - 00:35:05
However, high hopes won't help... 

00:35:05 - 00:35:11
if there's no logical, tangible way for me to safely execute said time heist. 

00:35:11 - 00:35:14
I believe the most likely outcome will be our collective demise. 

00:35:14 - 00:35:17
Not if we strictly follow the rules of time travel. 

00:35:17 - 00:35:20
All right? It means no talking to our past selves... 

00:35:20 - 00:35:21
no betting on sporting events. 

00:35:21 - 00:35:23
I'm gonna stop you right there, Scott. 

00:35:24 - 00:35:27
Are you seriously telling me that your plan to save the universe... 

00:35:28 - 00:35:29
is based on Back to the Future? 

00:35:30 - 00:35:32
Is it?
No.

00:35:32 - 00:35:35
Good. You had me worried there. 'Cause that would be horseshit. 

00:35:35 - 00:35:37
That's not how quantum physics works. 

00:35:37 - 00:35:38
Tony. 

00:35:40 - 00:35:42
We have to take a stand. 

00:35:42 - 00:35:44
We did stand. And yet, here we are. 

00:35:47 - 00:35:48
I know you got a lot on the line. 

00:35:48 - 00:35:51
You got a wife, a daughter. 

00:35:51 - 00:35:54
But I lost someone very important to me. 

00:35:54 - 00:35:55
A lotta people did. 

00:35:55 - 00:35:58
And now, now we have a chance to bring her back... 

00:35:59 - 00:36:01
to bring everyone back, and you're telling me that you won't even... 

00:36:01 - 00:36:03
That's right, Scott. I won't even. 

00:36:05 - 00:36:06
I can't. 

00:36:09 - 00:36:11
Mommy told me to come and save you. 

00:36:11 - 00:36:13
Good job. I'm saved. 

00:36:14 - 00:36:17
I wish you were coming here to ask me something else. Anything else. 

00:36:17 - 00:36:19
I'm honestly happy to see you guys, I just... 

00:36:19 - 00:36:21
Oh, look, the table's set for six.
Tony.

00:36:21 - 00:36:22
I get it. 

00:36:22 - 00:36:25
And I'm happy for you. I really am. 

00:36:26 - 00:36:27
But this is a second chance. 

00:36:28 - 00:36:30
I got my second chance right here, Cap. 

00:36:30 - 00:36:32
Can't roll the dice on it. 

00:36:34 - 00:36:36
If you don't talk shop, you can stay for lunch. 

00:36:39 - 00:36:40
Well, he's scared. 

00:36:41 - 00:36:42
He's not wrong. 

00:36:42 - 00:36:44
Yeah, but, I mean, what are we gonna do? 

00:36:44 - 00:36:46
We need him. What, are we gonna stop? 

00:36:47 - 00:36:49
No, I wanna do it right. 

00:36:52 - 00:36:53
We're gonna need a really big brain. 

00:36:55 - 00:36:56
Bigger than his? 

00:36:56 - 00:36:59
Come on, I feel like I'm the only one eating here. Try some of that. 

00:36:59 - 00:37:00
Have some eggs. 

00:37:01 - 00:37:02
I'm so confused. 

00:37:02 - 00:37:04
These are confusing times. 

00:37:04 - 00:37:06
Right, no, no. That's not what I meant. 

00:37:06 - 00:37:09
Nah, I get it. I'm kidding! 

00:37:09 - 00:37:11
I know, it's crazy. 

00:37:11 - 00:37:12
I'm wearing shirts now. 

00:37:12 - 00:37:15
Yeah. What? How? Why? 

00:37:16 - 00:37:18
Five years ago, we got our asses beat. 

00:37:19 - 00:37:20
Except it was worse for me... 

00:37:21 - 00:37:22
'cause I lost twice. 

00:37:22 - 00:37:24
First, Hulk lost, then Banner lost... 

00:37:25 - 00:37:26
and then, we all lost. 

00:37:26 - 00:37:27
No one blamed you, Bruce. 

00:37:27 - 00:37:29
I did. 

00:37:31 - 00:37:33
For years, I've been treating the Hulk like he's some kind of disease... 

00:37:33 - 00:37:35
something to get rid of. 

00:37:35 - 00:37:38
But then, I start looking at him as the cure. 

00:37:39 - 00:37:41
Eighteen months in the gamma lab. 

00:37:41 - 00:37:43
I put the brains and the brawn together... 

00:37:44 - 00:37:45
and now, look at me. 

00:37:46 - 00:37:47
Best of both worlds. 

00:37:48 - 00:37:49
Excuse me, Mr. Hulk?
Yes.

00:37:49 - 00:37:51
Can we get a photo? 

00:37:51 - 00:37:53
100%, little person. 

00:37:53 - 00:37:55
Come on, step on up. Do you mind? 

00:37:56 - 00:37:58
Oh, yeah, yeah.
Thanks.

00:37:58 - 00:38:00
Say "green." 

00:38:00 - 00:38:02
Green.
Green.

00:38:02 - 00:38:03
Did you get that? 

00:38:03 - 00:38:04
That's a good one. 

00:38:05 - 00:38:08
Did you want to grab one with me? I'm Ant-Man. 

00:38:11 - 00:38:13
They're Hulk fans. They don't know Ant-Man. 

00:38:13 - 00:38:14
Nobody does. 

00:38:15 - 00:38:16
No, he wants you to take a picture with him.
I don't want a picture.

00:38:16 - 00:38:17
Stranger danger. 

00:38:17 - 00:38:19
Yeah, look, he's even saying no, he doesn't. 

00:38:19 - 00:38:21
I get it. I don't want it, either.
But come on. The kid...

00:38:21 - 00:38:23
I don't want a picture with them. 

00:38:23 - 00:38:24
He's gonna feel bad.
Sorry.

00:38:24 - 00:38:25
They're happy to do it. They said they'll do it. 

00:38:25 - 00:38:27
I don't want to do it.
We can do it.

00:38:27 - 00:38:29
No, you feel bad.
Take the goddamn phone.

00:38:29 - 00:38:30
Okay. 

00:38:31 - 00:38:34
Thank you, Mr. Hulk.
No, it was great, kids. Thank you very much.

00:38:34 - 00:38:35
Hulk out! 

00:38:35 - 00:38:36
Bruce. 

00:38:37 - 00:38:38
Dab. 

00:38:38 - 00:38:40
Bruce.
Listen to your mom.

00:38:40 - 00:38:41
She knows better. 

00:38:41 - 00:38:43
About what we were saying. 

00:38:43 - 00:38:44
Right. 

00:38:46 - 00:38:49
The whole time travel do-over? 

00:38:50 - 00:38:54
Guys, it's outside of my area of expertise. 

00:38:54 - 00:38:56
Well, you pulled this off. 

00:38:57 - 00:39:00
I remember a time when that seemed pretty impossible, too. 

00:39:34 - 00:39:37
I've got a mild inspiration. I'd like to see if it checks out. 

00:39:37 - 00:39:41
So, I'd like to run one last sim before we pack it in for the night. 

00:39:41 - 00:39:45
This time, in the shape of a Mobius strip, inverted, please. 

00:39:45 - 00:39:46
Processing. 

00:39:50 - 00:39:52
Right, give me the eigenvalue of that particle... 

00:39:52 - 00:39:54
factoring in spectral decomp. 

00:39:55 - 00:39:57
That'll take a second.
Just a moment.

00:39:58 - 00:40:00
And don't worry if it doesn't pan out. I'm just kinda... 

00:40:02 - 00:40:04
Model rendered. 

00:40:15 - 00:40:16
Shit! 

00:40:17 - 00:40:18
Shit! 

00:40:22 - 00:40:24
What are you doing up, little miss? 

00:40:24 - 00:40:26
Shit.
Nope. We don't say that.

00:40:26 - 00:40:27
Only Mommy says that word. 

00:40:27 - 00:40:29
She coined it. It belongs to her. 

00:40:29 - 00:40:30
Why are you up? 

00:40:30 - 00:40:31
'Cause I've got some important shit going on here! 

00:40:31 - 00:40:33
Why do you think? 

00:40:33 - 00:40:36
No, I got something on my mind. I got something on my mind. 

00:40:36 - 00:40:37
Was it juice pops? 

00:40:39 - 00:40:40
Sure was. 

00:40:42 - 00:40:43
That's extortion. That's a word. 

00:40:43 - 00:40:45
What kind you want? 

00:40:45 - 00:40:46
Great minds think alike. 

00:40:46 - 00:40:48
Juice pops exactly... 

00:40:50 - 00:40:51
was on my mind. 

00:40:52 - 00:40:54
You done? Yeah? 

00:40:54 - 00:40:55
Now you are. 

00:40:56 - 00:40:57
Here. Wipe. 

00:41:00 - 00:41:03
Good. That face goes there. 

00:41:03 - 00:41:04
Tell me a story. 

00:41:04 - 00:41:06
A story. 

00:41:06 - 00:41:08
Once upon a time, Maguna went to bed. The end. 

00:41:08 - 00:41:10
That is a horrible story. 

00:41:10 - 00:41:12
Come on, that's your favorite story. 

00:41:12 - 00:41:14
Love you tons. 

00:41:16 - 00:41:17
I love you 3,000. 

00:41:19 - 00:41:20
Wow. 

00:41:27 - 00:41:30
3,000. That's crazy. 

00:41:31 - 00:41:33
Go to bed or I'll sell all your toys. 

00:41:34 - 00:41:35
Night night. 

00:41:36 - 00:41:37
Not that it's a competition... 

00:41:37 - 00:41:39
but she loves me 3,000. 

00:41:39 - 00:41:40
Does she, now? 

00:41:41 - 00:41:44
You were somewhere in the low 6 to 900 range. 

00:41:50 - 00:41:51
Whatcha reading? 

00:41:52 - 00:41:53
Just a book on composting. 

00:41:53 - 00:41:56
What's new with composting? 

00:41:57 - 00:41:59
Interesting science...
I figured it out.

00:42:00 - 00:42:01
By the way. 

00:42:02 - 00:42:05
And, you know, just so we're talking about the same thing... 

00:42:06 - 00:42:07
Time travel. 

00:42:08 - 00:42:09
What? 

00:42:13 - 00:42:14
Wow. 

00:42:18 - 00:42:19
That's amazing... 

00:42:20 - 00:42:21
and terrifying. 

00:42:22 - 00:42:23
That's right. 

00:42:30 - 00:42:32
We got really lucky. 

00:42:32 - 00:42:33
Yeah. 

00:42:33 - 00:42:35
I know. 

00:42:35 - 00:42:36
A lot of people didn't. 

00:42:36 - 00:42:38
Nope. And I can't help everybody. 

00:42:39 - 00:42:41
Sorta seems like you can. 

00:42:41 - 00:42:42
Not if I stop. 

00:42:44 - 00:42:47
I can put a pin in it right now and stop. 

00:42:47 - 00:42:48
Tony... 

00:42:49 - 00:42:51
trying to get you to stop... 

00:42:51 - 00:42:53
has been one of the few failures of my entire life. 

00:42:58 - 00:42:59
Something tells me... 

00:43:01 - 00:43:03
I should put it in a lockbox and drop it to the bottom of the lake... 

00:43:05 - 00:43:06
and go to bed. 

00:43:12 - 00:43:14
But would you be able to rest? 

00:43:19 - 00:43:22
Okay, here we go. Time travel test number one. 

00:43:22 - 00:43:25
Scott, fire up... 

00:43:25 - 00:43:27
the van thing. 

00:43:29 - 00:43:30
Breakers are set. 

00:43:30 - 00:43:32
Emergency generators are on standby. 

00:43:32 - 00:43:37
Good, because if we blow the grid, I don't want to lose Tiny here in the 1950s. 

00:43:37 - 00:43:38
Excuse me? 

00:43:38 - 00:43:40
He's kidding. 

00:43:40 - 00:43:42
You can't say things like that. 

00:43:42 - 00:43:44
It was a bad joke. 

00:43:46 - 00:43:47
You were kidding, right? 

00:43:47 - 00:43:50
I have no idea. We're talking about time travel here. 

00:43:50 - 00:43:53
Either it's all a joke, or none of it is. 

00:43:53 - 00:43:54
We're good! 

00:43:55 - 00:43:56
Get your helmet on. 

00:43:57 - 00:43:58
Scott, I'm gonna send you back a week... 

00:43:59 - 00:44:02
let you walk around for an hour, then bring you back in 10 seconds. 

00:44:02 - 00:44:03
Make sense? 

00:44:04 - 00:44:05
Perfectly not confusing. 

00:44:05 - 00:44:07
Good luck, Scott. You got this. 

00:44:09 - 00:44:12
You're right. I do, Captain America. 

00:44:14 - 00:44:15
On a count of three... 

00:44:15 - 00:44:19
Three, two, one. 

00:44:23 - 00:44:24
Guys? 

00:44:25 - 00:44:26
This doesn't feel right. 

00:44:27 - 00:44:27
What is this? 

00:44:28 - 00:44:28
What's going on?
Who is that?

00:44:29 - 00:44:29
Hold on.
Is that Scott?

00:44:30 - 00:44:31
Yes, it's Scott. 

00:44:33 - 00:44:36
What's going on, Bruce?
Oh, my back!

00:44:36 - 00:44:37
What is this?
Hold on a second.

00:44:37 - 00:44:39
Could I get a little space here?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

00:44:39 - 00:44:40
Can you bring him back?
I'm working on it.

00:44:47 - 00:44:48
It's a baby. 

00:44:49 - 00:44:50
It's Scott.
As a baby.

00:44:50 - 00:44:52
He'll grow.
Bring Scott back.

00:44:52 - 00:44:53
When I say kill the power, kill the power. 

00:44:53 - 00:44:55
Oh, my God. 

00:44:55 - 00:44:57
And... kill it! 

00:45:01 - 00:45:03
Somebody peed my pants. 

00:45:03 - 00:45:04
Oh, thank God. 

00:45:04 - 00:45:07
But I don't know if it was baby me or old me. 

00:45:11 - 00:45:13
Or just me me. 

00:45:13 - 00:45:14
Time travel! 

00:45:18 - 00:45:19
What? 

00:45:21 - 00:45:23
I see this as an absolute win. 

00:46:09 - 00:46:10
Why the long face? 

00:46:10 - 00:46:12
Let me guess, he turned into a baby. 

00:46:13 - 00:46:15
Among other things, yeah. What are you doing here? 

00:46:15 - 00:46:17
It's the EPR Paradox. 

00:46:18 - 00:46:20
Instead of pushing Lang through time, you might've wound up... 

00:46:20 - 00:46:21
pushing time through Lang. 

00:46:21 - 00:46:24
It's tricky, dangerous. Somebody could have cautioned you against it. 

00:46:24 - 00:46:25
You did. 

00:46:25 - 00:46:27
Oh, did I? 

00:46:27 - 00:46:28
Well, thank God I'm here. 

00:46:29 - 00:46:31
Regardless, I fixed it. 

00:46:32 - 00:46:34
A fully functioning time-space GPS. 

00:46:36 - 00:46:38
I just want peace. 

00:46:39 - 00:46:42
Turns out resentment is corrosive, and I hate it. 

00:46:43 - 00:46:44
Me, too. 

00:46:45 - 00:46:49
We got a shot at getting these stones, but I got to tell you my priorities. 

00:46:49 - 00:46:51
Bring back what we lost, I hope, yes. 

00:46:52 - 00:46:54
Keep what I found, I have to, at all costs. 

00:46:56 - 00:46:58
And maybe not die trying. 

00:46:58 - 00:46:59
Would be nice. 

00:47:02 - 00:47:03
Sounds like a deal. 

00:47:27 - 00:47:28
Tony, I don't know. 

00:47:28 - 00:47:29
Why? 

00:47:30 - 00:47:31
He made it for you. 

00:47:31 - 00:47:35
Plus, honestly, I have to get it out of the garage before Morgan takes it sledding. 

00:47:41 - 00:47:42
Thank you, Tony. 

00:47:43 - 00:47:44
Will you keep that a little quiet? 

00:47:45 - 00:47:46
Didn't bring one for the whole team. 

00:47:48 - 00:47:51
We are getting the whole team, yeah? 

00:47:52 - 00:47:53
We're working on that right now. 

00:48:11 - 00:48:12
Hey, Humie. 

00:48:13 - 00:48:15
Where's Big Green? 

00:48:15 - 00:48:17
The kitchen, I think. 

00:48:18 - 00:48:20
That's awesome. 

00:48:21 - 00:48:23
Rhodey, careful on re-entry. 

00:48:23 - 00:48:25
There's an idiot in the landing zone. 

00:48:26 - 00:48:27
Oh, God. 

00:48:28 - 00:48:30
What's up, Regular-Sized Man? 

00:49:21 - 00:49:25
Kind of a step down from the golden palaces and the magic hammers and whatnot. 

00:49:25 - 00:49:26
Hey, have a little compassion, pal. 

00:49:27 - 00:49:29
First, they lost Asgard, then half their people. 

00:49:29 - 00:49:30
They're probably just happy to have a home. 

00:49:30 - 00:49:32
You shouldn't have come. 

00:49:34 - 00:49:35
Valkyrie! 

00:49:35 - 00:49:38
Great to see you, angry girl! 

00:49:38 - 00:49:40
I think I liked you better either of the other ways. 

00:49:42 - 00:49:43
This is Rocket.
How ya doing?

00:49:46 - 00:49:47
He won't see you. 

00:49:47 - 00:49:48
It's that bad, huh? 

00:49:48 - 00:49:53
We only see him once a month when he comes in for "supplies." 

00:49:54 - 00:49:55
It's that bad. 

00:49:55 - 00:49:56
Yeah. 

00:50:09 - 00:50:10
What the...? 

00:50:13 - 00:50:15
Something died in here! 

00:50:16 - 00:50:18
Hello? Thor! 

00:50:19 - 00:50:21
Are you here about the cable? 

00:50:21 - 00:50:24
The Cinemax went out two weeks ago... 

00:50:24 - 00:50:27
and the sports are all kinda fuzzy and whatnot. 

00:50:28 - 00:50:29
Thor? 

00:50:37 - 00:50:39
Boys! Oh, my God! 

00:50:40 - 00:50:43
Oh, my God, it's so good to see you! 

00:50:44 - 00:50:45
Come here, cuddly little rascal. 

00:50:45 - 00:50:47
Yeah, no, I'm good. I'm good. 

00:50:48 - 00:50:49
That's not necessary. 

00:50:50 - 00:50:52
Hulk, you know my friends Miek and Korg, right? 

00:50:52 - 00:50:54
Hey, boys!
Hey, guys.

00:50:54 - 00:50:55
Long time no see. 

00:50:55 - 00:50:57
Beer's in the bucket. Feel free to log on to the Wi-Fi. 

00:50:58 - 00:50:59
No password, obviously. 

00:51:00 - 00:51:02
Thor, he's back. 

00:51:02 - 00:51:05
That kid on the TV just called me a dickhead again. 

00:51:05 - 00:51:06
Noobmaster. 

00:51:06 - 00:51:09
Yeah, NoobMaster69 called me a dickhead. 

00:51:09 - 00:51:10
I am sick of this. 

00:51:11 - 00:51:14
Noobmaster, hey, it's Thor again. You know, the God of Thunder. 

00:51:14 - 00:51:17
Listen, bud, if you don't log off this game immediately... 

00:51:17 - 00:51:20
I am gonna fly over to your house, come down to that basement you're hiding in... 

00:51:20 - 00:51:22
rip off your arms, and shove them up your butt! 

00:51:23 - 00:51:26
Oh, that's right, yes! Go cry to your father, you little weasel. 

00:51:27 - 00:51:28
Thank you, Thor. 

00:51:28 - 00:51:29
Let me know if he bothers you again, okay? 

00:51:29 - 00:51:31
Thank you very much. I will. 

00:51:31 - 00:51:33
So, you guys want a drink? What are we drinking? 

00:51:33 - 00:51:35
I've got beer, tequila, all sorts of things. 

00:51:38 - 00:51:40
Buddy. 

00:51:40 - 00:51:41
You all right? 

00:51:41 - 00:51:42
Yes, I'm fine. Why? 

00:51:42 - 00:51:44
Why, don't I look all right? 

00:51:44 - 00:51:45
You look like melted ice cream. 

00:51:47 - 00:51:49
So, what's up? You just here for a hang, or what? 

00:51:50 - 00:51:51
We need your help. 

00:51:52 - 00:51:54
There might be a chance we could fix everything. 

00:51:54 - 00:51:56
What, like the cable? 

00:51:56 - 00:51:58
'Cause that's been driving me bananas for weeks. 

00:51:58 - 00:51:59
Like Thanos. 

00:52:18 - 00:52:21
Don't say that name. 

00:52:22 - 00:52:25
Yeah, we don't actually say that name in here. 

00:52:30 - 00:52:32
Please take your hand off me. 

00:52:35 - 00:52:38
Now, I know that guy... 

00:52:39 - 00:52:40
might scare you. 

00:52:40 - 00:52:42
Why would I be...? 

00:52:42 - 00:52:45
Why would I be scared of that guy? 

00:52:45 - 00:52:47
I'm the one who killed that guy, remember? 

00:52:48 - 00:52:50
Anyone else here kill that guy? 

00:52:54 - 00:52:55
Nope. 

00:52:55 - 00:52:56
Didn't think so. 

00:52:57 - 00:53:02
Korg, why don't you tell everybody who chopped Thanos' big head off? 

00:53:02 - 00:53:03
Stormbreaker? 

00:53:03 - 00:53:05
Who was swinging Stormbreaker? 

00:53:09 - 00:53:11
I get it. You're in a rough spot, okay? 

00:53:12 - 00:53:13
I've been there myself. 

00:53:13 - 00:53:15
And you want to know who helped me out of it? 

00:53:15 - 00:53:18
Was it Natasha? 

00:53:18 - 00:53:20
It was you. 

00:53:20 - 00:53:22
You helped me. 

00:53:23 - 00:53:25
So, why don't you ask... 

00:53:26 - 00:53:28
the Asgardians down there... 

00:53:28 - 00:53:30
how much my help is worth? 

00:53:36 - 00:53:37
The ones that are left, anyway. 

00:53:38 - 00:53:39
I think we could bring them back. 

00:53:40 - 00:53:41
Stop. 

00:53:42 - 00:53:43
Stop, okay? 

00:53:44 - 00:53:47
I know you think I'm down here wallowing in my own self-pity... 

00:53:47 - 00:53:50
waiting to be rescued and saved... 

00:53:50 - 00:53:52
but I'm fine, okay. We're fine, aren't we? 

00:53:52 - 00:53:54
We're good here, mate. 

00:53:54 - 00:53:56
So, whatever it is that you're offering, we're not into it. 

00:53:56 - 00:53:57
Don't care. Couldn't care less. 

00:53:58 - 00:53:59
Goodbye. 

00:54:02 - 00:54:04
We need you, pal. 

00:54:13 - 00:54:15
There's beer on the ship. 

00:54:19 - 00:54:21
What kind? 

00:54:33 - 00:54:36
It's him! He's after Akihiko! 

00:55:03 - 00:55:05
Why are you doing this? 

00:55:06 - 00:55:08
We never did anything to you! 

00:55:09 - 00:55:10
You survived... 

00:55:10 - 00:55:12
Half the planet didn't. 

00:55:12 - 00:55:14
They got Thanos. 

00:55:14 - 00:55:15
You get me... 

00:55:21 - 00:55:23
You're done hurting people. 

00:55:24 - 00:55:26
WE hurt people? 

00:55:29 - 00:55:30
You're crazy! 

00:56:01 - 00:56:02
Wait! Help me! 

00:56:03 - 00:56:05
I'll give you anything! 

00:56:06 - 00:56:07
What do you want? 

00:56:07 - 00:56:10
What I want you can't give me. 

00:56:34 - 00:56:35
You shouldn't be here. 

00:56:38 - 00:56:40
Neither should you. 

00:56:46 - 00:56:47
I've got a job to do. 

00:56:49 - 00:56:50
Is that what you're calling this? 

00:56:51 - 00:56:54
Killing all these people isn't gonna bring your family back. 

00:57:00 - 00:57:01
We found something. 

00:57:03 - 00:57:05
A chance, maybe. 

00:57:08 - 00:57:09
Don't. 

00:57:10 - 00:57:12
Don't what? 

00:57:15 - 00:57:16
Don't give me hope. 

00:57:19 - 00:57:22
I'm sorry I couldn't give it to you sooner. 

00:57:43 - 00:57:45
You're drifting left. 

00:57:45 - 00:57:47
One side there, Lebowski. 

00:57:50 - 00:57:52
Ratchet, how's it going? 

00:57:52 - 00:57:53
It's Rocket. 

00:57:53 - 00:57:55
Take it easy. You're only a genius on Earth, pal. 

00:58:00 - 00:58:02
Time travel suit, not bad. 

00:58:03 - 00:58:05
Hey, hey, hey! Easy! Easy! 

00:58:05 - 00:58:06
I'm being very careful. 

00:58:06 - 00:58:08
No, you're being very Hulky. 

00:58:08 - 00:58:09
I'm being careful. 

00:58:09 - 00:58:10
These are Pym Particles, all right? 

00:58:10 - 00:58:13
And ever since Hank Pym got snapped out of existence, this is it. 

00:58:13 - 00:58:15
This is what we have. We're not making any more. 

00:58:15 - 00:58:17
Scott, calm down.
Sorry.

00:58:17 - 00:58:20
We've got enough for one round-trip each. That's it. 

00:58:20 - 00:58:21
No do-overs. 

00:58:22 - 00:58:24
Plus two test runs. 

00:58:28 - 00:58:29
One test run. 

00:58:30 - 00:58:32
All right. I'm not ready for this. 

00:58:32 - 00:58:33
I'm game. 

00:58:35 - 00:58:37
I'll do it. 

00:58:38 - 00:58:41
Clint, now you're gonna feel a little discombobulated from the chronoshift. 

00:58:41 - 00:58:43
Don't worry about that.
Wait a second. Let me ask you something.

00:58:43 - 00:58:45
If we can do this, you know... 

00:58:45 - 00:58:47
go back in time, why don't we just find baby Thanos? 

00:58:47 - 00:58:48
You know, and... 

00:58:52 - 00:58:54
First of all, that's horrible.
It's Thanos.

00:58:54 - 00:58:57
And secondly, time doesn't work that way. 

00:58:57 - 00:58:59
Changing the past doesn't change the future. 

00:58:59 - 00:59:02
Look, we go back, we get the stones before Thanos gets them... 

00:59:02 - 00:59:05
Thanos doesn't have the stones. Problem solved. 

00:59:05 - 00:59:07
Bingo.
That's not how it works.

00:59:07 - 00:59:09
Well, that's what I heard.
Wait, but who? Who told you that?

00:59:09 - 00:59:11
Star Trek, Terminator, Timecop... 

00:59:11 - 00:59:13
Time After Time.
Quantum Leap.

00:59:13 - 00:59:15
Wrinkle in Time, Somewhere in Time.
Hot Tub Time Machine.

00:59:15 - 00:59:18
Hot Tub Time Machine. Bill and Ted's Excellent Adventure. 

00:59:18 - 00:59:20
Basically, any movie that deals with time travel. 

00:59:20 - 00:59:22
Die Hard. No, that's not one. 

00:59:22 - 00:59:23
This is known. 

00:59:23 - 00:59:26
I don't know why everyone believes that, but that isn't true. 

00:59:26 - 00:59:28
Think about it. If you travel to the past... 

00:59:28 - 00:59:30
that past becomes your future... 

00:59:30 - 00:59:33
and your former present becomes the past... 

00:59:33 - 00:59:36
which can't now be changed by your new future. 

00:59:36 - 00:59:37
Exactly. 

00:59:38 - 00:59:41
So Back to the Future is a bunch of bullshit? 

00:59:45 - 00:59:46
All right, Clint. 

00:59:47 - 00:59:50
We're going in three, two... 

00:59:50 - 00:59:51
one. 

01:01:04 - 01:01:05
Cooper? 

01:01:05 - 01:01:07
Where are my headphones? 

01:01:07 - 01:01:08
Lila? 

01:01:08 - 01:01:10
I never had them.
Lila?

01:01:11 - 01:01:13
Yeah, you had them yesterday! 

01:01:13 - 01:01:15
Lila! Lila! 

01:01:20 - 01:01:21
Yeah, Dad? 

01:01:25 - 01:01:26
Dad? 

01:01:28 - 01:01:30
Lila! 

01:01:36 - 01:01:38
Hey. Hey, look at me. 

01:01:38 - 01:01:39
You okay? 

01:01:40 - 01:01:42
Yeah. Yeah. 

01:01:44 - 01:01:45
It worked. 

01:01:47 - 01:01:48
It worked. 

01:01:51 - 01:01:53
Okay, so the how works. 

01:01:54 - 01:01:57
Now, we got to figure out the when and the where. 

01:01:58 - 01:02:00
Almost everyone in this room has had an encounter... 

01:02:00 - 01:02:02
with at least one of the six Infinity Stones. 

01:02:02 - 01:02:03
Or substitute the word "encounter"... 

01:02:03 - 01:02:06
for "damn near been killed" by one of the six Infinity Stones. 

01:02:06 - 01:02:07
Well, I haven't... 

01:02:07 - 01:02:10
but I don't even know what the hell you're all talking about. 

01:02:10 - 01:02:15
Regardless, we only have enough Pym Particles for one round-trip each. 

01:02:15 - 01:02:18
And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history. 

01:02:18 - 01:02:19
Our history. 

01:02:20 - 01:02:23
So, not a lot of convenient spots to just drop in, yeah? 

01:02:23 - 01:02:25
Which means we have to pick our targets. 

01:02:25 - 01:02:26
Correct. 

01:02:28 - 01:02:29
So, let's start with the Aether. 

01:02:29 - 01:02:31
Thor, what do you know? 

01:02:36 - 01:02:37
Is he asleep? 

01:02:38 - 01:02:40
No, no. I'm pretty sure he's dead. 

01:02:44 - 01:02:45
Where to start? 

01:02:47 - 01:02:49
The Aether, firstly, is not a stone. 

01:02:50 - 01:02:51
Someone called it a stone before. 

01:02:53 - 01:02:57
It's more of an angry sludge sort of a thing... 

01:02:57 - 01:03:00
so someone's gonna need to amend that and stop saying that. 

01:03:00 - 01:03:03
Here's an interesting story, though, about the Aether. 

01:03:03 - 01:03:05
My grandfather, many years ago... 

01:03:05 - 01:03:09
had to hide the stone from the Dark Elves. 

01:03:10 - 01:03:11
Scary beings. 

01:03:12 - 01:03:13
So, Jane, actually... 

01:03:14 - 01:03:15
Oh, there she is. 

01:03:16 - 01:03:19
Yeah, so Jane was an old flame of mine. 

01:03:20 - 01:03:23
You know, she stuck her hand inside a rock this one time... 

01:03:24 - 01:03:26
and then the Aether stuck itself inside her... 

01:03:27 - 01:03:29
and she became very, very sick. 

01:03:29 - 01:03:32
And so I had to take her to Asgard, which is where I'm from... 

01:03:32 - 01:03:34
and we had to try and fix her. 

01:03:34 - 01:03:36
We were dating at the time, you see... 

01:03:36 - 01:03:39
and I got to introduce her to my mother... 

01:03:41 - 01:03:43
who's dead and... 

01:03:44 - 01:03:48
Oh, you know, Jane and I aren't even dating anymore, so... 

01:03:49 - 01:03:50
Yes, these things happen, though. You know? 

01:03:50 - 01:03:52
Nothing lasts forever. The only thing that... 

01:03:52 - 01:03:54
Why don't you come sit down?
I'm not done yet.

01:03:54 - 01:03:57
The only thing that is permanent in life is impermanence. 

01:03:57 - 01:04:00
Awesome. Eggs? Breakfast? 

01:04:00 - 01:04:02
No. I'd like a Bloody Mary. 

01:04:02 - 01:04:04
Quill said he stole the Power Stone from Morag. 

01:04:05 - 01:04:08
Is that a person?
No, Morag's a planet.

01:04:09 - 01:04:10
Quill was a person. 

01:04:11 - 01:04:13
Like a planet? Like in outer space? 

01:04:13 - 01:04:18
Oh, look. It's like a little puppy, all happy and everything. 

01:04:18 - 01:04:21
Do you wanna go to space? You wanna go to space, puppy? 

01:04:21 - 01:04:22
I'll take you to space. 

01:04:24 - 01:04:25
Thanos found the Soul Stone on Vormir. 

01:04:26 - 01:04:28
What is Vormir? 

01:04:28 - 01:04:29
A dominion of death... 

01:04:30 - 01:04:32
at the very center of celestial existence. 

01:04:33 - 01:04:37
It's where Thanos murdered my sister. 

01:04:44 - 01:04:45
Not it. 

01:04:47 - 01:04:48
That Time Stone guy.
Doctor Strange.

01:04:48 - 01:04:50
Yeah, what kind of doctor was he? 

01:04:50 - 01:04:52
Ear-nose-throat meets rabbit-from-hat. 

01:04:53 - 01:04:54
Nice place in the Village, though. 

01:04:54 - 01:04:56
Yeah, on Sullivan Street? 

01:04:56 - 01:04:57
Bleecker Street. 

01:04:57 - 01:04:58
Wait, he lived in New York? 

01:04:59 - 01:05:01
No, he lived in Toronto.
Yeah, on Bleecker and Sullivan.

01:05:01 - 01:05:03
Have you been listening to anything?
Guys.

01:05:03 - 01:05:06
If you pick the right year, there are three stones in New York. 

01:05:09 - 01:05:11
Shut the front door. 

01:05:13 - 01:05:15
All right. We have a plan. 

01:05:16 - 01:05:20
Six stones, three teams, one shot. 

01:05:30 - 01:05:32
Five years ago, we lost. 

01:05:33 - 01:05:34
All of us. 

01:05:36 - 01:05:38
We lost friends. 

01:05:38 - 01:05:40
We lost family. 

01:05:42 - 01:05:44
We lost a part of ourselves. 

01:05:45 - 01:05:48
Today, we have a chance to take it all back. 

01:05:49 - 01:05:52
You know your teams. You know your missions. 

01:05:53 - 01:05:55
Get the stones. Get them back. 

01:05:56 - 01:05:57
One round-trip each. 

01:05:57 - 01:05:58
No mistakes... 

01:05:58 - 01:06:00
no do-overs. 

01:06:00 - 01:06:02
Most of us are going somewhere we know. 

01:06:02 - 01:06:04
That doesn't mean we should know what to expect. 

01:06:05 - 01:06:06
Be careful. 

01:06:07 - 01:06:08
Look out for each other. 

01:06:10 - 01:06:12
This is the fight of our lives... 

01:06:12 - 01:06:14
and we're gonna win. 

01:06:16 - 01:06:17
Whatever it takes. 

01:06:20 - 01:06:22
Good luck. 

01:06:22 - 01:06:23
He's pretty good at that. 

01:06:23 - 01:06:24
Right?
All right.

01:06:25 - 01:06:27
You heard the man. Stroke those keys, Jolly Green. 

01:06:28 - 01:06:29
Trackers engaged. 

01:06:30 - 01:06:32
You promise to bring that back in one piece, right? 

01:06:32 - 01:06:34
Yeah, yeah, yeah. 

01:06:34 - 01:06:36
Okay, I'll do my best. 

01:06:36 - 01:06:38
As promises go, that was pretty lame. 

01:06:41 - 01:06:42
See ya in a minute. 

01:07:36 - 01:07:38
All right, we all have our assignments. 

01:07:38 - 01:07:40
Two stones uptown, one stone down. 

01:07:40 - 01:07:42
Stay low. Keep an eye on the clock. 

01:07:57 - 01:07:59
Maybe smash a few things along the way. 

01:08:00 - 01:08:02
I think it's gratuitous, but whatever. 

01:08:30 - 01:08:33
I'd be careful going that way. We just had the floors waxed. 

01:08:39 - 01:08:40
Yeah, I'm looking for Doctor Strange. 

01:08:42 - 01:08:45
You're about five years too early. 

01:08:46 - 01:08:49
Stephen Strange is currently performing surgery about 20 blocks that way. 

01:08:51 - 01:08:52
What do you want from him? 

01:08:53 - 01:08:54
That, actually. 

01:08:57 - 01:08:58
I'm afraid not. 

01:08:59 - 01:09:00
Sorry, but I wasn't asking. 

01:09:01 - 01:09:02
You don't want to do this. 

01:09:02 - 01:09:04
You're right, I don't. But I need that stone... 

01:09:04 - 01:09:05
and I don't have time to debate it. 

01:09:14 - 01:09:16
Let's start over, shall we? 

01:09:27 - 01:09:29
For you, Lady Jane. 

01:09:29 - 01:09:32
Do you have anything with pants? 

01:09:32 - 01:09:33
Pants? 

01:09:33 - 01:09:35
Never mind. These will be fine. Thank you. 

01:09:35 - 01:09:37
Yes, milady.
There's Jane.

01:09:38 - 01:09:39
All right. 

01:09:41 - 01:09:42
Here's the deal, tubby. 

01:09:42 - 01:09:45
You're gonna charm her, and I'm gonna poke her with this thing... 

01:09:45 - 01:09:47
and extract the Reality Stone, and get gone lickety-split. 

01:09:49 - 01:09:52
I'll be right back, okay? The wine cellar is just down here. 

01:09:52 - 01:09:55
My father used to have this huge barrel of Aakonian ale. 

01:09:55 - 01:09:57
I'll see if the scullery has a couple of to-go cups. 

01:09:57 - 01:09:59
Hey. Hey! Aren't you drunk enough already? 

01:10:06 - 01:10:08
If you could send Loki some soup.
Yes, milady.

01:10:08 - 01:10:12
And ask our librarians to pull some volumes from the astronomy shelf. 

01:10:18 - 01:10:20
Who's the fancy broad? 

01:10:21 - 01:10:23
That's my mother. 

01:10:23 - 01:10:25
She dies today. 

01:10:26 - 01:10:27
Oh, that is today? 

01:10:34 - 01:10:36
I can't do this. I can't do this. 

01:10:37 - 01:10:39
I shouldn't be here. I shouldn't have come. 

01:10:39 - 01:10:40
It's a bad idea! 

01:10:40 - 01:10:41
Come here.
No, no, no.

01:10:41 - 01:10:44
I think I'm having a panic attack. 

01:10:44 - 01:10:46
Come here. Right here.
I shouldn't be here. This is bad.

01:10:47 - 01:10:48
You think you're the only one who lost people? 

01:10:48 - 01:10:50
What do you think we're doing here? 

01:10:51 - 01:10:53
I lost the only family I ever had. 

01:10:53 - 01:10:55
Quill, Groot, Drax, the chick with the antenna... 

01:10:55 - 01:10:57
all gone. 

01:10:58 - 01:10:59
I get you miss your mom... 

01:10:59 - 01:11:00
but she's gone. 

01:11:01 - 01:11:02
Really gone. 

01:11:02 - 01:11:05
And there are plenty of people who are only kind of gone... 

01:11:05 - 01:11:06
and you can help them. 

01:11:07 - 01:11:11
So, is it too much to ask that you brush the crumbs out of your beard... 

01:11:11 - 01:11:13
make schmoopy talk to Pretty Pants... 

01:11:14 - 01:11:16
and when she's not looking, suck out the Infinity Stone... 

01:11:17 - 01:11:18
and help me get my family back? 

01:11:20 - 01:11:21
Okay. 

01:11:21 - 01:11:22
Are you crying? 

01:11:23 - 01:11:24
No. 

01:11:26 - 01:11:27
Yes. 

01:11:27 - 01:11:28
I feel like I'm losing it. 

01:11:29 - 01:11:30
Get it together! 

01:11:30 - 01:11:31
You can do this. 

01:11:32 - 01:11:33
You can do this. 

01:11:36 - 01:11:37
All right? 

01:11:38 - 01:11:39
Yes, I can. 

01:11:39 - 01:11:40
Good. 

01:11:42 - 01:11:44
I can do this. I can do this. 

01:11:45 - 01:11:47
I can't do this. 

01:11:47 - 01:11:50
All right, heartbreaker, she's alone. This is our shot. 

01:11:50 - 01:11:53
Thor? Thor! 

01:12:03 - 01:12:05
All right, bring it down, Blue. 

01:12:05 - 01:12:07
Right on that line. That's it. Down, down. 

01:12:12 - 01:12:14
Hey, can we hurry it up? 

01:12:14 - 01:12:16
Guys, chop-chop. Come on. We're on the clock. 

01:12:16 - 01:12:18
All that is really helpful. 

01:12:20 - 01:12:21
Take care, okay?
Yeah.

01:12:22 - 01:12:24
Get that stone and come back. No messing around. 

01:12:25 - 01:12:26
Hey.
We got this.

01:12:26 - 01:12:28
Let's get it done.
Yes, sir.

01:12:28 - 01:12:29
I'll see you back. 

01:12:30 - 01:12:31
You guys watch each other's six. 

01:12:32 - 01:12:33
Yeah. 

01:12:42 - 01:12:43
Coordinates for Vormir are laid in. 

01:12:45 - 01:12:47
All they have to do is not fall out. 

01:12:53 - 01:12:55
We're a long way from Budapest. 

01:13:00 - 01:13:01
Okay, so... 

01:13:03 - 01:13:06
we just wait around for this Quill guy to show up... 

01:13:06 - 01:13:08
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it? 

01:13:09 - 01:13:10
Let's take cover. 

01:13:12 - 01:13:14
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones. 

01:13:15 - 01:13:16
Wait a minute. What are you talking about right now? 

01:13:16 - 01:13:18
Who else is looking for these stones? 

01:13:21 - 01:13:22
My father... 

01:13:23 - 01:13:24
my sister... 

01:13:25 - 01:13:26
and me. 

01:13:26 - 01:13:27
And you? 

01:13:29 - 01:13:30
Where are you right now? 

01:13:59 - 01:14:00
You're welcome. 

01:14:00 - 01:14:03
I didn't ask for your help. 

01:14:03 - 01:14:05
And yet, you always need it. 

01:14:09 - 01:14:11
Get up. Father wants us back on the ship. 

01:14:11 - 01:14:12
Why? 

01:14:12 - 01:14:14
He's found an Infinity Stone. 

01:14:19 - 01:14:20
Where? 

01:14:21 - 01:14:22
On a planet called Morag. 

01:14:24 - 01:14:26
Father's plan is finally in motion. 

01:14:26 - 01:14:28
One stone isn't six, Nebula. 

01:14:28 - 01:14:29
It's a start. 

01:14:30 - 01:14:31
If he gets all of them... 

01:14:44 - 01:14:48
Ronan's located the Power Stone. I'm dispatching you to his ship. 

01:14:48 - 01:14:49
He won't like that. 

01:14:49 - 01:14:52
His alternative is death. 

01:14:53 - 01:14:55
Ronan's obsession... 

01:14:56 - 01:14:58
clouds his judgment. 

01:15:02 - 01:15:04
We will not fail you, Father. 

01:15:05 - 01:15:07
No, you won't. 

01:15:10 - 01:15:11
I swear... 

01:15:13 - 01:15:14
I will make you proud. 

01:15:23 - 01:15:26
We just wait around for this Quill guy to show up... 

01:15:27 - 01:15:29
and then he leads us to the Power Stone, is that it? 

01:15:29 - 01:15:30
Let's take cover. 

01:15:31 - 01:15:34
We're not the only ones in 2014 looking for the stones. 

01:15:37 - 01:15:38
Who was that? 

01:15:38 - 01:15:39
I don't know. 

01:15:39 - 01:15:42
My head is splitting. I don't know. 

01:15:43 - 01:15:46
Her synaptic drive was probably damaged in battle. 

01:15:56 - 01:15:58
Bring her to my ship. 

01:16:06 - 01:16:07
Better hustle, Cap. 

01:16:07 - 01:16:09
Things look like they're just about wrapped up here. 

01:16:09 - 01:16:11
Got it. I'm approaching the elevator now. 

01:16:17 - 01:16:19
If it's all the same to you... 

01:16:21 - 01:16:23
I'll have that drink now. 

01:16:23 - 01:16:25
All right, get him on his feet. 

01:16:25 - 01:16:28
We can all stand around posing up a storm later. 

01:16:28 - 01:16:29
By the way, feel free to clean up. 

01:16:30 - 01:16:33
Mr. Rogers, I almost forgot that that suit... 

01:16:33 - 01:16:35
did nothing for your ass. 

01:16:35 - 01:16:36
No one asked you to look, Tony. 

01:16:36 - 01:16:38
It's ridiculous.
I think you look great, Cap.

01:16:38 - 01:16:41
As far as I'm concerned, that's America's ass. 

01:16:41 - 01:16:43
Who gets the magic wand? 

01:16:43 - 01:16:45
S.T.R.I.K.E. team's coming to secure it. 

01:16:55 - 01:16:57
We can take that off your hands. 

01:16:57 - 01:16:58
By all means. 

01:17:00 - 01:17:02
Careful with that thing. 

01:17:02 - 01:17:04
Yeah, unless you want your mind erased. 

01:17:04 - 01:17:05
And not in a fun way. 

01:17:05 - 01:17:06
We promise to be careful. 

01:17:06 - 01:17:07
Who are these guys? 

01:17:07 - 01:17:09
They are S.H.I.E.I.D. 

01:17:09 - 01:17:12
Well, actually Hydra, but we didn't know that yet. 

01:17:12 - 01:17:14
Seriously? You didn't? 

01:17:15 - 01:17:16
I mean, they look like bad guys. 

01:17:16 - 01:17:18
You're small, but you're talking loud. 

01:17:18 - 01:17:20
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue. 

01:17:20 - 01:17:22
On my way down to coordinate search and rescue. 

01:17:22 - 01:17:24
I mean, honestly, how do you keep your food down? 

01:17:25 - 01:17:26
Shut up. 

01:17:27 - 01:17:28
All right, you're up, little buddy. 

01:17:28 - 01:17:30
There's our stone. 

01:17:30 - 01:17:31
All right. 

01:17:31 - 01:17:33
Flick me. 

01:17:47 - 01:17:48
Move.
Hey.

01:17:48 - 01:17:50
Hey, hey. Buddy! 

01:17:50 - 01:17:52
What do you think? Maximum occupancy has been reached. 

01:17:52 - 01:17:53
Take the stairs. 

01:17:53 - 01:17:55
Yeah. Stop, stop. 

01:17:58 - 01:18:00
"Take the stairs." Hate the stairs. 

01:18:04 - 01:18:06
All right, Cap, I got our scepter in the elevator... 

01:18:07 - 01:18:08
just passing the 80th floor. 

01:18:09 - 01:18:10
On it. 

01:18:11 - 01:18:13
Head to the lobby.
All right, I'll see you there.

01:18:13 - 01:18:15
Evidence secure. 

01:18:15 - 01:18:16
We're en route to Doctor List. 

01:18:17 - 01:18:20
No. No hitches at all, Mr. Secretary. 

01:18:25 - 01:18:26
Captain. 

01:18:26 - 01:18:28
I thought you were coordinating search and rescue. 

01:18:29 - 01:18:30
Change of plans. 

01:18:34 - 01:18:35
Hey, Cap. 

01:18:37 - 01:18:38
Rumlow. 

01:18:44 - 01:18:46
I just got a call from the secretary. 

01:18:46 - 01:18:48
I'm gonna be running point on the scepter. 

01:18:50 - 01:18:53
Sir? I don't understand. 

01:18:55 - 01:18:57
We got word there may be an attempt to steal it. 

01:18:57 - 01:18:59
Sorry, Cap. 

01:18:59 - 01:19:00
We can't give you the scepter. 

01:19:01 - 01:19:03
I'm gonna have to call the director. 

01:19:03 - 01:19:05
That's okay. Trust me. 

01:19:09 - 01:19:10
Hail Hydra. 

01:19:24 - 01:19:26
So many stairs! 

01:19:38 - 01:19:40
Thumbelina, do you copy? I've got eyes on the prize. 

01:19:41 - 01:19:42
It is go time. 

01:19:42 - 01:19:43
Bombs away. 

01:19:50 - 01:19:53
Is that Axe Body Spray? 

01:19:53 - 01:19:55
Yeah, I had a can in the desk for emergencies. Relax. 

01:19:55 - 01:19:56
Can we focus, please? 

01:19:56 - 01:19:58
I'm going inside you... 

01:19:58 - 01:19:59
now. 

01:20:05 - 01:20:07
May I ask you where you're going? 

01:20:07 - 01:20:09
Bit of lunch and then Asgard. I'm sorry, you are...? 

01:20:09 - 01:20:10
Alexander Pierce. 

01:20:10 - 01:20:13
He's the man above the folks behind Nick Fury. 

01:20:13 - 01:20:14
My friends call me Mr. Secretary. 

01:20:14 - 01:20:17
I'm gonna have to ask you to turn that prisoner over to me. 

01:20:17 - 01:20:19
Loki will be answering to Odin himself. 

01:20:19 - 01:20:21
No, he's going to answer to us. Odin can have what's left. 

01:20:21 - 01:20:23
And I'm gonna need that case. 

01:20:23 - 01:20:25
That's been S.H.I.E.I.D. property for over 70 years. 

01:20:25 - 01:20:26
Hand over the case, Stark. 

01:20:26 - 01:20:29
All right, move it, Stuart Little. Things are getting dicey out here. Let's go. 

01:20:29 - 01:20:31
I'm not gonna argue who's got the higher authority here... 

01:20:31 - 01:20:32
You promise me you won't die? 

01:20:32 - 01:20:35
We're only giving me a mild cardiac dysrhythmia. 

01:20:35 - 01:20:37
That doesn't sound mild. 

01:20:37 - 01:20:38
I need the case. 

01:20:38 - 01:20:40
I know you got a lot of pull, I'm just saying, jurisdiction... 

01:20:40 - 01:20:41
Okay, then give me the case. 

01:20:41 - 01:20:43
Well, jurisdiction...
Hand it over.

01:20:43 - 01:20:44
Do it, Lang! 

01:20:44 - 01:20:47
Get your hands off me.
Window's closing. Pull my pin.

01:20:47 - 01:20:49
Here goes! 

01:20:52 - 01:20:53
Stark?
Stark?

01:20:54 - 01:20:56
He's convulsing. Give him air! 

01:20:56 - 01:20:57
Medic!
Medic!

01:20:58 - 01:20:59
Give these guys some help. 

01:21:00 - 01:21:01
Speak to me. 

01:21:01 - 01:21:03
Stark, is it your chest machine? 

01:21:06 - 01:21:07
Breathe, breathe. 

01:21:12 - 01:21:15
Good job. Meet me in the alley. I'm gonna grab a quick slice. 

01:21:20 - 01:21:22
No stairs! 

01:21:30 - 01:21:32
Come on, Stark, stay with us. 

01:21:32 - 01:21:35
I'm going to try something. Okay? I have no idea if it's going to work. 

01:21:36 - 01:21:37
Yes! 

01:21:37 - 01:21:38
Oh, that worked a treat. 

01:21:38 - 01:21:39
Dude, that was so crazy. 

01:21:40 - 01:21:41
I had no idea if that was gonna work. 

01:21:41 - 01:21:43
The case.
The case is...

01:21:43 - 01:21:45
Where's the case? Where's Loki? 

01:21:46 - 01:21:47
Loki! 

01:21:47 - 01:21:49
That wasn't supposed to happen, was it? 

01:21:49 - 01:21:50
We blew it. 

01:21:50 - 01:21:51
Loki? 

01:21:53 - 01:21:55
Tony, what's going on? 

01:21:56 - 01:21:57
Tell me you found that Cube. 

01:22:00 - 01:22:02
You got to be shitting me. 

01:22:06 - 01:22:08
I have eyes on Loki. 14th floor. 

01:22:08 - 01:22:10
I'm not Loki... 

01:22:13 - 01:22:15
and I don't wanna hurt you. 

01:22:24 - 01:22:25
I can do this all day. 

01:22:25 - 01:22:26
Yeah, I know. 

01:22:26 - 01:22:27
I know. 

01:23:00 - 01:23:01
Where did you get this? 

01:23:12 - 01:23:15
Bucky is alive. 

01:23:19 - 01:23:20
What? 

01:23:35 - 01:23:36
That is America's ass. 

01:23:41 - 01:23:42
Please, please. 

01:23:42 - 01:23:44
I'm sorry, I can't help you, Bruce. 

01:23:45 - 01:23:48
If I give up the Time Stone to help your reality, I'm dooming my own. 

01:23:48 - 01:23:50
With all due respect, all right... 

01:23:50 - 01:23:53
I'm not sure the science really supports that. 

01:23:59 - 01:24:03
The Infinity Stones create what you experience as the flow of time. 

01:24:03 - 01:24:05
Remove one of the stones... 

01:24:05 - 01:24:07
and that flow splits. 

01:24:07 - 01:24:10
Now, this may benefit your reality... 

01:24:10 - 01:24:12
but my new one, not so much. 

01:24:12 - 01:24:14
In this new branch reality... 

01:24:14 - 01:24:17
without our chief weapon against the forces of darkness... 

01:24:18 - 01:24:20
our world would be overrun. 

01:24:20 - 01:24:22
Millions will suffer. 

01:24:22 - 01:24:23
So, tell me, Doctor. 

01:24:24 - 01:24:26
Can your science prevent all that? 

01:24:26 - 01:24:27
No... 

01:24:28 - 01:24:29
but we can erase it. 

01:24:29 - 01:24:31
Because once we're done with the stones... 

01:24:31 - 01:24:33
we can return each one to its own timeline... 

01:24:33 - 01:24:35
at the moment it was taken. 

01:24:35 - 01:24:38
So, chronologically... 

01:24:39 - 01:24:40
in that reality... 

01:24:42 - 01:24:44
it never left. 

01:24:46 - 01:24:49
Yes, but you're leaving out the most important part. 

01:24:53 - 01:24:55
In order to return the stones, you have to survive. 

01:24:56 - 01:24:58
We will. I will. I promise. 

01:24:59 - 01:25:01
I can't risk this reality on a promise. 

01:25:03 - 01:25:07
It's the duty of the Sorcerer Supreme to protect the Time Stone. 

01:25:08 - 01:25:10
Then why the hell did Strange give it away? 

01:25:12 - 01:25:13
What did you say? 

01:25:13 - 01:25:15
Strange. He gave it away. He gave it to Thanos. 

01:25:16 - 01:25:17
Willingly?
Yes.

01:25:21 - 01:25:23
Why?
I have no idea.

01:25:23 - 01:25:25
Maybe he made a mistake. 

01:25:35 - 01:25:36
Or I did. 

01:25:56 - 01:25:59
Strange is meant to be the best of us. 

01:25:59 - 01:26:02
So, he must've done it for a reason. 

01:26:02 - 01:26:04
I fear you might be right. 

01:26:09 - 01:26:10
Thank you. 

01:26:16 - 01:26:18
I'm counting on you, Bruce. 

01:26:20 - 01:26:21
We all are. 

01:26:42 - 01:26:43
Run diagnostics. 

01:26:44 - 01:26:46
Show me her memory file. 

01:26:48 - 01:26:50
Sire, the file appears entangled. 

01:26:51 - 01:26:53
It was a memory, but not hers. 

01:26:55 - 01:26:56
There's another consciousness... 

01:26:56 - 01:26:57
sharing her network. 

01:26:58 - 01:26:59
Another Nebula. 

01:27:01 - 01:27:03
Impossible. 

01:27:03 - 01:27:06
This duplicate carries a time stamp... 

01:27:07 - 01:27:09
from nine years in the future. 

01:27:13 - 01:27:16
Where is this other Nebula? 

01:27:16 - 01:27:18
In our solar system on Morag. 

01:27:20 - 01:27:21
Can you access her? 

01:27:21 - 01:27:24
Yes, the two are linked. 

01:27:24 - 01:27:26
Search the duplicate's memories... 

01:27:26 - 01:27:28
for Infinity Stones. 

01:27:32 - 01:27:35
And these stones have been in a lot of different places throughout history. 

01:27:35 - 01:27:36
Our history. 

01:27:36 - 01:27:38
So, not a lot of convenient spots... 

01:27:38 - 01:27:39
to just drop in. 

01:27:40 - 01:27:41
Which means we have to pick our targets. 

01:27:41 - 01:27:43
Correct.
Freeze image.

01:27:45 - 01:27:46
Terrans. 

01:27:47 - 01:27:49
Avengers. 

01:27:50 - 01:27:51
Unruly wretches. 

01:27:52 - 01:27:53
What's that reflection? 

01:27:55 - 01:27:56
Amplify this, Maw. 

01:27:59 - 01:28:01
I don't understand. 

01:28:05 - 01:28:07
Two Nebulas. 

01:28:07 - 01:28:09
No. The same Nebula... 

01:28:10 - 01:28:12
from two different times. 

01:28:13 - 01:28:15
Set course for Morag. 

01:28:15 - 01:28:18
And scan the duplicate's memories. 

01:28:18 - 01:28:21
I wanna see everything. 

01:28:30 - 01:28:34
My ladies, I'll see you after. I'll see you after. Go on ahead. 

01:28:48 - 01:28:49
What are you doing? 

01:28:51 - 01:28:52
Oh, God! 

01:28:52 - 01:28:55
You're better off leaving the sneaking to your brother. 

01:28:55 - 01:28:57
No, I wasn't sneaking. I was just going for a walk. 

01:28:57 - 01:28:58
What are you wearing? 

01:28:58 - 01:29:01
I always wear this. It's one of my favorites. 

01:29:05 - 01:29:06
What's wrong with your eye? 

01:29:06 - 01:29:07
Oh, my eye. 

01:29:08 - 01:29:10
Remember the Battle of Harokin... 

01:29:10 - 01:29:13
when I got hit in the face with the broadsword? 

01:29:16 - 01:29:18
You're not the Thor I know at all, are you? 

01:29:19 - 01:29:21
Yes, I am. 

01:29:21 - 01:29:24
The future hasn't been kind to you, has it? 

01:29:24 - 01:29:26
I didn't say I was from the future. 

01:29:27 - 01:29:29
I was raised by witches, boy. 

01:29:30 - 01:29:33
I see with more than eyes, you know that. 

01:29:35 - 01:29:37
Yeah, I'm totally from the future. 

01:29:37 - 01:29:39
Yes, you are, honey. 

01:29:39 - 01:29:41
I really need to talk to you. 

01:29:41 - 01:29:42
We can talk. 

01:30:06 - 01:30:08
His head was over there... 

01:30:08 - 01:30:11
and his body over there... 

01:30:12 - 01:30:15
I mean, what was the point? I was too late. 

01:30:15 - 01:30:17
I was just standing there. 

01:30:18 - 01:30:20
Some idiot with an axe. 

01:30:20 - 01:30:22
Now, you're no idiot. 

01:30:23 - 01:30:24
You're here, aren't you? 

01:30:25 - 01:30:27
Seeking counsel from the wisest person in Asgard. 

01:30:27 - 01:30:28
I am. Yes. 

01:30:29 - 01:30:30
Idiot, no. 

01:30:30 - 01:30:32
A failure? 

01:30:32 - 01:30:33
Absolutely. 

01:30:33 - 01:30:35
That's a little bit harsh. 

01:30:35 - 01:30:36
Do you know what that makes you? 

01:30:38 - 01:30:40
Just like everyone else. 

01:30:40 - 01:30:43
I'm not supposed to be like everyone else, am I? 

01:30:43 - 01:30:46
Everyone fails at who they're supposed to be, Thor. 

01:30:47 - 01:30:50
The measure of a person, of a hero... 

01:30:50 - 01:30:54
is how well they succeed at being who they are. 

01:30:59 - 01:31:00
I've really missed you, Mom. 

01:31:06 - 01:31:08
Thor! I got it! 

01:31:09 - 01:31:10
Get that rabbit! 

01:31:13 - 01:31:15
Mom, I have to tell you something. 

01:31:15 - 01:31:17
No, son, you don't. 

01:31:17 - 01:31:20
You're here to repair your future, not mine. 

01:31:20 - 01:31:22
This is about your future. 

01:31:22 - 01:31:23
It's none of my business. 

01:31:27 - 01:31:28
Hi. 

01:31:28 - 01:31:30
You must be Mom. 

01:31:31 - 01:31:32
I got the thing. Come on. We got to move. 

01:31:32 - 01:31:34
I wish we had more time. 

01:31:34 - 01:31:36
No, this was a gift. 

01:31:36 - 01:31:39
Now you go and be the man you're meant to be. 

01:31:40 - 01:31:41
I love you, Mom. 

01:31:41 - 01:31:42
I love you. 

01:31:46 - 01:31:48
And eat a salad. 

01:31:49 - 01:31:50
Come on, we got to go. 

01:31:51 - 01:31:52
Goodbye.
Three...

01:31:52 - 01:31:53
Two...
No, wait!

01:31:57 - 01:31:58
What am I looking at? 

01:31:58 - 01:32:00
Sometimes it takes a second. 

01:32:09 - 01:32:11
I'm still worthy. 

01:32:12 - 01:32:14
Oh, boy. 

01:32:15 - 01:32:17
Goodbye, Mom.
Goodbye.

01:32:56 - 01:32:58
So, he's an idiot? 

01:32:59 - 01:33:01
Yeah. 

01:33:09 - 01:33:11
What's that? 

01:33:11 - 01:33:13
The tool of a thief. 

01:33:22 - 01:33:24
This is the part where spikes come out... 

01:33:24 - 01:33:26
with skeletons on the end of them and everything. 

01:33:26 - 01:33:27
What are you talking about? 

01:33:27 - 01:33:30
When you break into a place called "The Temple of the Power Stone"... 

01:33:30 - 01:33:31
there's gonna be a bunch of booby traps. 

01:33:31 - 01:33:33
Oh, my God.
Okay. All right. Go ahead.

01:34:07 - 01:34:08
I wasn't always like this. 

01:34:09 - 01:34:10
Me either. 

01:34:12 - 01:34:13
But we work with what we got, right? 

01:34:17 - 01:34:19
Let's sync up. 

01:34:21 - 01:34:23
Three, two, one. 

01:34:36 - 01:34:37
You murdered trillions! 

01:34:38 - 01:34:39
You should be grateful. 

01:34:41 - 01:34:42
Where are the stones? 

01:34:42 - 01:34:43
Gone. 

01:34:44 - 01:34:45
Reduced to atoms. 

01:34:46 - 01:34:48
You used them two days ago! 

01:34:48 - 01:34:51
I used the stones to destroy the stones. 

01:34:51 - 01:34:53
It nearly killed me. 

01:34:53 - 01:34:55
But the work is done. 

01:34:55 - 01:34:57
It always will be. 

01:34:58 - 01:35:02
I am inevitable. 

01:35:03 - 01:35:05
What did you do to them? 

01:35:05 - 01:35:06
Nothing. 

01:35:07 - 01:35:09
Yet. 

01:35:10 - 01:35:14
They're not trying to stop something I'm going to do in our time. 

01:35:14 - 01:35:18
They're trying to undo something I've already done in theirs. 

01:35:18 - 01:35:20
The stones. 

01:35:21 - 01:35:23
I found them all. 

01:35:25 - 01:35:26
I won. 

01:35:27 - 01:35:30
Tipped the cosmic scales to balance. 

01:35:34 - 01:35:35
This is your future. 

01:35:36 - 01:35:38
It's my destiny. 

01:35:39 - 01:35:41
My father is many things. 

01:35:41 - 01:35:43
A liar is not one of them. 

01:35:47 - 01:35:49
Thank you, daughter. 

01:35:49 - 01:35:51
Perhaps I treated you too harshly. 

01:35:55 - 01:35:58
And that is destiny fulfilled. 

01:35:59 - 01:36:00
Sire... 

01:36:00 - 01:36:01
your daughter... 

01:36:04 - 01:36:05
No! 

01:36:05 - 01:36:06
Is a traitor. 

01:36:07 - 01:36:09
That's not me. It's not, I could never... 

01:36:09 - 01:36:10
I would never betray you. 

01:36:11 - 01:36:12
Never. Never. 

01:36:18 - 01:36:19
I know. 

01:36:20 - 01:36:23
And you'll have the chance to prove it. 

01:36:30 - 01:36:31
No! 

01:36:32 - 01:36:33
He knows! 

01:36:37 - 01:36:39
Barton! Barton, come in. 

01:36:40 - 01:36:41
Romanoff! 

01:36:42 - 01:36:43
Come in, we have a problem. 

01:36:44 - 01:36:45
Come on! 

01:36:45 - 01:36:46
Come in, we have a... 

01:36:46 - 01:36:48
Thanos knows. 

01:36:48 - 01:36:50
Thanos... 

01:37:03 - 01:37:04
Cap. 

01:37:06 - 01:37:08
Sorry, buddy, we got a problem. 

01:37:09 - 01:37:11
Yeah, we do. 

01:37:11 - 01:37:12
Well, what are we gonna do now? 

01:37:12 - 01:37:13
You know what? Give me a break, Steve. 

01:37:13 - 01:37:15
I just got hit in the head with the Hulk. 

01:37:15 - 01:37:16
You said that we had one shot. 

01:37:17 - 01:37:18
This was our shot. 

01:37:18 - 01:37:20
We shot it. It's shot. Six stones or nothing. 

01:37:20 - 01:37:22
It was six stones or nothing.
You're repeating yourself, you know that?

01:37:22 - 01:37:23
You're repeating yourself. 

01:37:23 - 01:37:25
You're repeating yourself. You're repeating yourself. 

01:37:25 - 01:37:27
Dude. Come on!
No. You never wanted a time heist.

01:37:27 - 01:37:28
You weren't on board with the time heist. 

01:37:28 - 01:37:29
I dropped the ball.
You ruined the time heist.

01:37:29 - 01:37:31
Is that what I did?
Yeah.

01:37:31 - 01:37:33
Are there any other options with the Tesseract? 

01:37:33 - 01:37:34
No, no, no, there's no other options. 

01:37:34 - 01:37:35
There's no do-overs. 

01:37:36 - 01:37:38
We're not going anywhere else. We have one particle left. 

01:37:38 - 01:37:39
Each. 

01:37:39 - 01:37:41
That's it. All right? We use that... 

01:37:41 - 01:37:42
bye-bye, you're not going home. 

01:37:43 - 01:37:45
Yeah, well, if we don't try... 

01:37:45 - 01:37:46
then no one else is going home, either. 

01:37:46 - 01:37:47
I got it. 

01:37:48 - 01:37:52
There's another way to retake the Tesseract and acquire new particles. 

01:37:53 - 01:37:54
Little stroll down memory lane. 

01:37:55 - 01:37:57
Military installation, Garden State. 

01:38:01 - 01:38:02
When were they both there? 

01:38:02 - 01:38:05
They were there at a time... I have a vaguely exact idea. 

01:38:05 - 01:38:07
How vague?
What are you talking about?

01:38:07 - 01:38:08
Where are we going? 

01:38:08 - 01:38:09
I know for a fact they were there. 

01:38:09 - 01:38:11
Who's they? What are we doing?
And I know how I know.

01:38:13 - 01:38:14
Guys, what is it? 

01:38:15 - 01:38:17
Looks like we're improvising. 

01:38:17 - 01:38:18
Great.
What are we improvising?

01:38:18 - 01:38:20
Scott, get this back to the compound. 

01:38:20 - 01:38:21
Suit up. 

01:38:21 - 01:38:23
What's in New Jersey?
0-4.

01:38:23 - 01:38:24
0-4. 

01:38:24 - 01:38:25
0-7.
0-7.

01:38:25 - 01:38:27
Excuse me.
1-9-7-0.

01:38:27 - 01:38:28
Are you sure? 

01:38:28 - 01:38:30
Cap? Captain? 

01:38:30 - 01:38:32
Steve? Sorry. 

01:38:32 - 01:38:33
America. Rogers. 

01:38:34 - 01:38:35
Look, if you do this... 

01:38:35 - 01:38:38
and it doesn't work, you're not coming back. 

01:38:39 - 01:38:41
Thanks for the pep talk, pissant. 

01:38:42 - 01:38:43
You trust me? 

01:38:44 - 01:38:45
I do. 

01:38:46 - 01:38:47
Your call. 

01:38:48 - 01:38:50
Here we go. 

01:39:06 - 01:39:09
Hey, man! Make love, not war. 

01:39:15 - 01:39:18
Clearly you weren't actually born here, right? 

01:39:18 - 01:39:20
The idea of me was. 

01:39:21 - 01:39:23
Right. Well, imagine you're S.H.I.E.I.D... 

01:39:23 - 01:39:26
running a quasi-fascistic intelligence organization... 

01:39:27 - 01:39:29
where do you hide it? 

01:39:29 - 01:39:31
In plain sight. 

01:39:59 - 01:40:00
Good luck on your mission, Captain. 

01:40:00 - 01:40:03
Good luck on your project, Doctor. 

01:40:06 - 01:40:07
You new here? 

01:40:10 - 01:40:11
Not exactly. 

01:40:18 - 01:40:20
Come on, you bastard. 

01:40:27 - 01:40:28
Gotcha. 

01:40:46 - 01:40:47
Back in the game. 

01:40:50 - 01:40:51
Arnim, you in there? 

01:40:52 - 01:40:53
Arnim? 

01:40:58 - 01:41:00
Hey! 

01:41:00 - 01:41:02
The door is this way, pal. 

01:41:03 - 01:41:04
Oh, yeah. 

01:41:04 - 01:41:06
Looking for Doctor Zola, have you seen him? 

01:41:06 - 01:41:10
Yeah, Doctor Zola. No, I haven't seen a soul. 

01:41:11 - 01:41:12
Pardon me. 

01:41:13 - 01:41:15
Do I know you? 

01:41:16 - 01:41:17
No, sir. 

01:41:19 - 01:41:20
I'm a visitor from MIT. 

01:41:21 - 01:41:22
MIT. 

01:41:23 - 01:41:24
Got a name? 

01:41:24 - 01:41:25
Howard. 

01:41:25 - 01:41:28
That'll be easy to remember.
Howard...

01:41:29 - 01:41:30
Potts. 

01:41:31 - 01:41:33
Well, I'm Howard Stark. 

01:41:33 - 01:41:34
Hi. 

01:41:34 - 01:41:35
Shake that, don't pull it. 

01:41:35 - 01:41:36
Yeah. 

01:41:38 - 01:41:40
You look a little green around the gills, there, Potts. 

01:41:40 - 01:41:42
I'm fine. Just long hours. 

01:41:43 - 01:41:44
You wanna get some air? 

01:41:47 - 01:41:49
Hello, Potts.
Yeah.

01:41:49 - 01:41:50
That'd be swell.
That way.

01:41:50 - 01:41:51
Okay. 

01:41:51 - 01:41:53
Need your briefcase? 

01:41:57 - 01:42:00
You're not one of those beatniks, are you, Potts? 

01:42:06 - 01:42:08
Hello?
Doctor Pym?

01:42:08 - 01:42:10
That would be the number that you called, yes. 

01:42:10 - 01:42:12
This is Captain Stevens from shipping. 

01:42:13 - 01:42:14
We have a package for you. 

01:42:14 - 01:42:15
Bring it up. 

01:42:15 - 01:42:17
That's the thing, sir, we can't. 

01:42:18 - 01:42:21
I'm confused. I thought that was your job. 

01:42:21 - 01:42:23
Well, it's just... 

01:42:23 - 01:42:24
Sir, the box is glowing... 

01:42:24 - 01:42:27
and to be honest, some of our mail guys aren't feeling that great. 

01:42:27 - 01:42:29
They didn't open it, did they? 

01:42:29 - 01:42:31
Yeah, they did. You better get down here. 

01:42:32 - 01:42:34
Excuse me! Out of the way! 

01:43:01 - 01:43:05
So, flowers and sauerkraut. You got a big date tonight? 

01:43:06 - 01:43:07
My wife's expecting. 

01:43:07 - 01:43:10
And too much time at the office. 

01:43:12 - 01:43:13
Congratulations. 

01:43:13 - 01:43:16
Thanks. Hold this, will ya?
Yeah, sure.

01:43:17 - 01:43:19
How far along is she?
I don't know.

01:43:21 - 01:43:23
She's at the point where she can't stand the sound of my chewing. 

01:43:23 - 01:43:27
I guess I'll be eating dinner in the pantry again. 

01:43:28 - 01:43:29
I have a little girl. 

01:43:29 - 01:43:31
A girl would be nice. 

01:43:31 - 01:43:33
Less of a chance she'd turn out exactly like me. 

01:43:33 - 01:43:35
What'd be so awful about that? 

01:43:35 - 01:43:40
Let's just say that the greater good has rarely outweighed my own self-interest. 

01:43:44 - 01:43:46
And you've never seen these two men before? 

01:43:46 - 01:43:48
No, I've got an eye for this. The two of them looked fishy. 

01:43:48 - 01:43:50
Can you describe them?
One of them had a hippie beard.

01:43:50 - 01:43:52
Hippie. Like Bee Gees or Mungo Jerry? 

01:43:52 - 01:43:53
Definitely Mungo Jerry. 

01:43:54 - 01:43:56
Yeah, this is Chesler. I need every available MP to sublevel six. 

01:43:56 - 01:43:58
We have a potential breach. 

01:44:16 - 01:44:17
I said bring them in. 

01:44:17 - 01:44:19
They're trying, ma'am, but Braddock's unit has been stopped by lightning strikes. 

01:44:19 - 01:44:20
Oh, for the love of... 

01:44:20 - 01:44:22
I'll look at the weather projections. 

01:44:46 - 01:44:48
It's not lightning strikes we're looking at. 

01:44:59 - 01:45:01
So, where you at with names? 

01:45:01 - 01:45:04
Well, if it's a boy, my wife likes Elmonzo. 

01:45:05 - 01:45:07
Might wanna let that stew awhile. You got time. 

01:45:09 - 01:45:11
Let me ask you a question. 

01:45:12 - 01:45:15
When your kid was born, were you nervous? 

01:45:15 - 01:45:16
Wildly. 

01:45:17 - 01:45:18
Yeah.
Did you feel qualified?

01:45:18 - 01:45:22
Like you had any idea how to successfully operate that thing? 

01:45:22 - 01:45:25
I literally pieced it together as I went along. 

01:45:25 - 01:45:27
I thought about what my dad did. 

01:45:28 - 01:45:31
My old man, he never met a problem he couldn't solve with a belt. 

01:45:31 - 01:45:33
I thought my dad was tough on me. 

01:45:33 - 01:45:36
And now, looking back on it, I just remember the good stuff. 

01:45:36 - 01:45:38
You know? He did drop the odd pearl. 

01:45:38 - 01:45:39
Yeah? Like what? 

01:45:40 - 01:45:43
"No amount of money ever bought a second of time." 

01:45:44 - 01:45:45
Smart guy. 

01:45:46 - 01:45:47
He did his best. 

01:45:49 - 01:45:53
I'll tell you, that kid's not even here yet and there's nothing I wouldn't do for him. 

01:46:01 - 01:46:03
Good to meet you, Potts. 

01:46:03 - 01:46:04
Yeah. 

01:46:05 - 01:46:06
Howard... 

01:46:06 - 01:46:08
everything's gonna be all right. 

01:46:11 - 01:46:12
Thank you... 

01:46:13 - 01:46:15
for everything... 

01:46:15 - 01:46:17
you've done for this country. 

01:46:20 - 01:46:21
Jarvis. 

01:46:25 - 01:46:26
Have we ever met that guy? 

01:46:28 - 01:46:30
You meet a lot of people, sir. 

01:46:33 - 01:46:34
Seems very familiar. 

01:46:35 - 01:46:37
Weird beard. 

01:46:45 - 01:46:46
You're weak. 

01:46:46 - 01:46:48
I'm you. 

01:47:05 - 01:47:07
You could stop this. 

01:47:08 - 01:47:09
You know you want to. 

01:47:10 - 01:47:12
Did you see what happens in the future? 

01:47:14 - 01:47:16
Thanos finds the Soul Stone. 

01:47:17 - 01:47:19
You wanna know how he does that? 

01:47:21 - 01:47:25
You wanna know what he does to you? 

01:47:26 - 01:47:27
That's enough. 

01:47:39 - 01:47:41
You disgust me. 

01:47:42 - 01:47:47
But that doesn't mean you're useless. 

01:48:09 - 01:48:10
How do I look? 

01:48:17 - 01:48:18
Wow. 

01:48:19 - 01:48:22
Under different circumstances... 

01:48:22 - 01:48:24
this would be totally awesome. 

01:48:36 - 01:48:39
I bet the raccoon didn't have to climb a mountain. 

01:48:39 - 01:48:41
Technically he's not a raccoon, you know? 

01:48:41 - 01:48:43
Whatever. He eats garbage. 

01:48:43 - 01:48:45
Welcome. 

01:48:48 - 01:48:49
Natasha. 

01:48:49 - 01:48:50
Daughter of Ivan. 

01:48:52 - 01:48:53
Clint. 

01:48:53 - 01:48:55
Son of Edith. 

01:49:00 - 01:49:02
Who are you? 

01:49:03 - 01:49:05
Consider me a guide... 

01:49:05 - 01:49:07
to you... 

01:49:07 - 01:49:09
and to all who seek the Soul Stone. 

01:49:09 - 01:49:10
Oh, good. 

01:49:10 - 01:49:12
You tell us where it is, then we'll be on our way. 

01:49:16 - 01:49:19
If only it were that easy. 

01:49:31 - 01:49:34
What you seek lies in front of you. 

01:49:36 - 01:49:38
As does what you fear. 

01:49:43 - 01:49:45
The stone's down there. 

01:49:45 - 01:49:47
For one of you. 

01:49:48 - 01:49:49
For the other... 

01:49:52 - 01:49:54
In order to take the stone... 

01:49:54 - 01:49:57
you must lose that which you love. 

01:49:59 - 01:50:02
An everlasting exchange. 

01:50:03 - 01:50:07
A soul for a soul. 

01:50:09 - 01:50:11
How's it going? 

01:50:14 - 01:50:16
Jesus. 

01:50:16 - 01:50:18
Maybe he's making this shit up. 

01:50:18 - 01:50:20
No. 

01:50:21 - 01:50:22
I don't think so. 

01:50:22 - 01:50:25
Why? 'Cause he knows your daddy's name? 

01:50:26 - 01:50:27
I didn't. 

01:50:29 - 01:50:31
Thanos left here with the stone... 

01:50:32 - 01:50:33
without his daughter. 

01:50:33 - 01:50:35
That's not a coincidence. 

01:50:37 - 01:50:38
Yeah. 

01:50:40 - 01:50:42
Whatever it takes. 

01:50:46 - 01:50:48
Whatever it takes. 

01:50:52 - 01:50:54
If we don't get that stone... 

01:50:54 - 01:50:56
billions of people stay dead. 

01:50:57 - 01:50:58
Yeah. 

01:51:00 - 01:51:02
Then I guess we both know who it's got to be. 

01:51:03 - 01:51:04
I guess we do. 

01:51:12 - 01:51:17
I'm starting to think we mean different people here, Natasha. 

01:51:18 - 01:51:19
For the last five years, I've been trying to do one thing. 

01:51:20 - 01:51:21
Get to right here. 

01:51:21 - 01:51:23
That's all it's been about. Bringing everybody back. 

01:51:23 - 01:51:25
No, don't you get all decent on me now. 

01:51:25 - 01:51:27
What, you think I wanna do it? 

01:51:28 - 01:51:30
I'm trying to save your life, you idiot. 

01:51:30 - 01:51:32
Yeah, well, I don't want you to. How's that? 

01:51:33 - 01:51:35
Natasha, you know what I've done. 

01:51:37 - 01:51:39
You know what I've become. 

01:51:41 - 01:51:44
I don't judge people on their worst mistakes. 

01:51:48 - 01:51:49
Maybe you should. 

01:51:50 - 01:51:51
You didn't. 

01:51:58 - 01:52:00
You're a pain in my ass, you know that? 

01:52:11 - 01:52:12
Okay. 

01:52:14 - 01:52:15
You win. 

01:52:22 - 01:52:23
Tell my family I love 'em. 

01:52:27 - 01:52:28
You tell 'em yourself. 

01:53:01 - 01:53:02
Damn you. 

01:53:09 - 01:53:10
Wait. 

01:53:18 - 01:53:20
Let me go. 

01:53:21 - 01:53:22
No. 

01:53:24 - 01:53:25
No. Please, no. 

01:53:29 - 01:53:30
It's okay. 

01:53:33 - 01:53:34
Please. 

01:53:36 - 01:53:37
No! 

01:55:18 - 01:55:19
Did we get 'em all? 

01:55:20 - 01:55:22
Are you telling me this actually worked? 

01:55:27 - 01:55:28
Clint, where's Nat? 

01:55:58 - 01:55:59
Do we know if she had family? 

01:56:00 - 01:56:01
Yeah. 

01:56:01 - 01:56:02
Us. 

01:56:03 - 01:56:05
What? 

01:56:06 - 01:56:08
What are you doing?
Just asked him a question.

01:56:08 - 01:56:09
Yeah, no, you're acting like she's dead. 

01:56:09 - 01:56:12
Why are we acting like she's dead? We have the stones, right? 

01:56:12 - 01:56:13
As long as we have the stones... 

01:56:13 - 01:56:15
Cap, we can bring her back. Isn't that right? 

01:56:15 - 01:56:17
So, stop this shit. We're the Avengers. Get it together. 

01:56:17 - 01:56:18
Can't get her back. 

01:56:21 - 01:56:23
What's he...? What? 

01:56:23 - 01:56:24
It can't be undone. 

01:56:25 - 01:56:26
It can't. 

01:56:29 - 01:56:32
Look, I'm sorry, no offense, but you're a very earthly being, okay? 

01:56:32 - 01:56:33
And we're talking about space magic. 

01:56:33 - 01:56:35
And "can't" seems very definitive. Don't you think? 

01:56:36 - 01:56:38
Yeah, look, I know that I'm way outside my pay grade here. 

01:56:39 - 01:56:40
But she still isn't here, is she? 

01:56:40 - 01:56:41
No, that's my point. 

01:56:41 - 01:56:44
It can't be undone. 

01:56:45 - 01:56:48
Or that's at least what the red, floating guy had to say. 

01:56:48 - 01:56:50
Maybe you wanna go talk to him, okay? 

01:56:50 - 01:56:53
Go grab your hammer and you go fly and you talk to him. 

01:57:01 - 01:57:03
It was supposed to be me. 

01:57:06 - 01:57:08
She sacrificed her life for that goddamn stone. 

01:57:08 - 01:57:10
She bet her life on it. 

01:57:14 - 01:57:17
She's not coming back. 

01:57:19 - 01:57:20
We have to make it worth it. 

01:57:21 - 01:57:22
We have to. 

01:57:24 - 01:57:25
We will. 

01:57:50 - 01:57:51
Boom! 

01:57:57 - 01:57:58
All right, the glove's ready. 

01:57:59 - 01:58:01
Question is, who's gonna snap their freakin' fingers? 

01:58:02 - 01:58:04
I'll do it.
Excuse me?

01:58:04 - 01:58:05
It's okay. 

01:58:05 - 01:58:06
Stop, stop. Slow down. 

01:58:06 - 01:58:08
Thor. Just wait. 

01:58:08 - 01:58:10
We haven't decided who's gonna put that on yet. 

01:58:10 - 01:58:13
I'm sorry. What, we're all just sitting around waiting for the right opportunity? 

01:58:13 - 01:58:14
We should at least discuss it. 

01:58:14 - 01:58:18
Look, sitting here staring at the thing is not gonna bring everybody back. 

01:58:19 - 01:58:22
I'm the strongest Avenger, okay? So, this responsibility falls upon me. 

01:58:22 - 01:58:24
Normally, you're right.
It's my duty.

01:58:24 - 01:58:26
It's not about that.
It's not that.

01:58:26 - 01:58:27
Hey, buddy...
Stop it! Just let me.

01:58:30 - 01:58:32
Just let me do it. 

01:58:32 - 01:58:35
Just let me do something good. Something right. 

01:58:35 - 01:58:36
Look, it's not just the fact... 

01:58:36 - 01:58:38
that that glove is channeling enough energy to light up a continent. 

01:58:38 - 01:58:40
I'm telling you. You're in no condition. 

01:58:40 - 01:58:43
What do you think is coursing through my veins right now? 

01:58:44 - 01:58:45
Cheez Whiz? 

01:58:47 - 01:58:48
Lightning. 

01:58:48 - 01:58:50
Yeah.
Lightning.

01:58:50 - 01:58:51
Lightning won't help you, pal. 

01:58:51 - 01:58:53
It's got to be me. 

01:58:54 - 01:58:57
You saw what those stones did to Thanos. 

01:58:57 - 01:58:58
They almost killed him. 

01:59:00 - 01:59:02
None of you could survive. 

01:59:02 - 01:59:04
How do we know you will? 

01:59:04 - 01:59:05
We don't. 

01:59:05 - 01:59:08
But the radiation's mostly gamma. 

01:59:11 - 01:59:13
It's like... 

01:59:15 - 01:59:17
I was made for this. 

01:59:36 - 01:59:37
Good to go, yeah? 

01:59:39 - 01:59:40
Let's do it. 

01:59:41 - 01:59:44
Okay, remember, everyone Thanos snapped away five years ago... 

01:59:44 - 01:59:46
you're just bringing them back to now, today. 

01:59:46 - 01:59:48
Don't change anything from the last five years. 

01:59:49 - 01:59:50
Got it. 

02:00:07 - 02:00:10
Friday, do me a favor and activate Barn Door Protocol, will ya? 

02:00:10 - 02:00:11
Yes, boss. 

02:00:20 - 02:00:22
Everybody comes home. 

02:00:45 - 02:00:46
Take it off! Take it off! 

02:00:46 - 02:00:48
No, wait. Bruce, are you okay? 

02:00:49 - 02:00:50
Talk to me, Banner. 

02:00:53 - 02:00:54
I'm okay. 

02:00:55 - 02:00:56
I'm okay. 

02:01:27 - 02:01:29
Bruce! 

02:01:30 - 02:01:32
Don't move him. 

02:01:39 - 02:01:41
Did it work?
We're not sure. It's okay.

02:02:27 - 02:02:28
Honey. 

02:02:28 - 02:02:29
Clint? 

02:02:29 - 02:02:31
Honey. 

02:02:32 - 02:02:33
Guys... 

02:02:35 - 02:02:37
I think it worked. 

02:03:19 - 02:03:21
I can't breathe! I can't breathe! 

02:03:22 - 02:03:24
Canopy, canopy, canopy. 

02:03:31 - 02:03:33
Rhodey, Rocket, get out of here. 

02:03:34 - 02:03:35
Let me up! Let me up! 

02:03:36 - 02:03:37
Come on! 

02:03:47 - 02:03:48
Rhodey! 

02:03:56 - 02:03:59
Mayday, Mayday! Does anybody copy? We're on the lower level. It's flooding! 

02:04:00 - 02:04:01
What? What? 

02:04:01 - 02:04:04
We are drowning! Does anybody copy? Mayday! 

02:04:04 - 02:04:06
Wait! I'm here! 

02:04:06 - 02:04:08
I'm here. Can you hear me? 

02:04:27 - 02:04:29
Cap? 

02:04:52 - 02:04:54
Okay. 

02:05:13 - 02:05:14
Daughter. 

02:05:14 - 02:05:15
Yes, Father. 

02:05:17 - 02:05:19
So, this is the future. 

02:05:20 - 02:05:21
Well done. 

02:05:21 - 02:05:23
Thank you, Father. 

02:05:23 - 02:05:24
They suspected nothing. 

02:05:27 - 02:05:28
The arrogant never do. 

02:05:31 - 02:05:32
Go. 

02:05:33 - 02:05:36
Find the stones, bring them to me. 

02:05:36 - 02:05:38
What will you do? 

02:05:39 - 02:05:41
Wait. 

02:06:06 - 02:06:07
Tell me something. 

02:06:09 - 02:06:11
In the future... 

02:06:11 - 02:06:13
what happens to you and me? 

02:06:15 - 02:06:17
I try to kill you. 

02:06:19 - 02:06:20
Several times. 

02:06:21 - 02:06:23
But eventually... 

02:06:23 - 02:06:25
we become friends. 

02:06:27 - 02:06:29
We become sisters. 

02:06:36 - 02:06:37
Come on. 

02:06:39 - 02:06:41
We can stop him. 

02:06:49 - 02:06:51
Come on, buddy, wake up! 

02:06:51 - 02:06:53
That's my man. 

02:06:54 - 02:06:56
You lose this again, I'm keeping it. 

02:06:59 - 02:07:00
What happened? 

02:07:01 - 02:07:03
You mess with time, it tends to mess back. 

02:07:03 - 02:07:04
You'll see. 

02:07:26 - 02:07:27
What's he been doing? 

02:07:29 - 02:07:31
Absolutely nothing. 

02:07:32 - 02:07:34
Where are the stones? 

02:07:35 - 02:07:36
Somewhere under all this. 

02:07:38 - 02:07:40
All I know is he doesn't have 'em. 

02:07:40 - 02:07:42
So, we keep it that way. 

02:07:42 - 02:07:43
You know it's a trap, right? 

02:07:44 - 02:07:45
Yeah. 

02:07:45 - 02:07:46
I don't much care. 

02:07:47 - 02:07:48
Good. 

02:07:49 - 02:07:52
Just as long as we're all in agreement. 

02:08:01 - 02:08:03
Let's kill him properly this time. 

02:08:13 - 02:08:16
You could not live with your own failure. 

02:08:17 - 02:08:19
Where did that bring you? 

02:08:22 - 02:08:24
Back to me. 

02:08:27 - 02:08:30
I thought by eliminating half of life... 

02:08:31 - 02:08:33
the other half would thrive. 

02:08:33 - 02:08:35
But you've shown me... 

02:08:36 - 02:08:38
that's impossible. 

02:08:40 - 02:08:43
And as long as there are those that remember what was... 

02:08:43 - 02:08:48
there will always be those that are unable to accept what can be. 

02:08:49 - 02:08:50
They will resist. 

02:08:51 - 02:08:53
Yep, we're all kinds of stubborn. 

02:08:54 - 02:08:55
I'm thankful. 

02:08:57 - 02:08:59
Because now... 

02:08:59 - 02:09:01
I know what I must do. 

02:09:02 - 02:09:05
I will shred this universe... 

02:09:05 - 02:09:07
down to its last atom. 

02:09:08 - 02:09:10
And then... 

02:09:10 - 02:09:12
with the stones you've collected for me... 

02:09:13 - 02:09:15
create a new one... 

02:09:15 - 02:09:17
teeming with life... 

02:09:17 - 02:09:19
that knows not what it has lost... 

02:09:20 - 02:09:22
but only what it has been given. 

02:09:25 - 02:09:26
A grateful universe. 

02:09:27 - 02:09:28
Born out of blood. 

02:09:29 - 02:09:30
They'll never know it. 

02:09:31 - 02:09:34
Because you won't be alive to tell them. 

02:09:49 - 02:09:50
See you on the other side, man. 

02:09:53 - 02:09:55
Hang on! I'm coming! 

02:10:25 - 02:10:26
Yeah! 

02:10:41 - 02:10:42
Oh, hey. 

02:10:42 - 02:10:44
I know you. 

02:10:47 - 02:10:48
Father... 

02:10:49 - 02:10:50
I have the stones. 

02:10:50 - 02:10:51
What? 

02:10:53 - 02:10:54
Stop. 

02:10:59 - 02:11:00
You're betraying us? 

02:11:06 - 02:11:08
You don't have to do this. 

02:11:10 - 02:11:13
I am this. 

02:11:13 - 02:11:15
No, you're not. 

02:11:15 - 02:11:17
You've seen what we become. 

02:11:23 - 02:11:26
Nebula, listen to her. 

02:11:27 - 02:11:28
You can change. 

02:11:35 - 02:11:36
He won't let me. 

02:11:38 - 02:11:39
No! 

02:11:58 - 02:12:00
Okay, Thor. Hit me. 

02:12:16 - 02:12:17
Boss, wake up! 

02:13:09 - 02:13:10
I knew it! 

02:14:32 - 02:14:35
In all my years of conquest... 

02:14:37 - 02:14:38
violence... 

02:14:39 - 02:14:41
slaughter... 

02:14:42 - 02:14:45
it was never personal. 

02:14:47 - 02:14:50
But I'll tell you now... 

02:14:52 - 02:14:58
what I'm about to do to your stubborn, annoying little planet... 

02:15:00 - 02:15:02
I'm gonna enjoy it... 

02:15:03 - 02:15:05
very, very much. 

02:16:09 - 02:16:10
Hey, Cap, you read me? 

02:16:16 - 02:16:18
Cap, it's Sam. Can you hear me? 

02:16:22 - 02:16:24
On your left. 

02:17:49 - 02:17:51
Is that everyone? 

02:17:51 - 02:17:53
What? You wanted more? 

02:18:20 - 02:18:22
Avengers... 

02:18:27 - 02:18:28
assemble. 

02:19:03 - 02:19:04
Die! 

02:19:25 - 02:19:28
No, no, give me that. You have the little one. 

02:19:41 - 02:19:42
Hey! 

02:19:43 - 02:19:44
Holy cow! 

02:19:44 - 02:19:46
You will not believe what's been going on. 

02:19:46 - 02:19:47
Do you remember when we were in space? 

02:19:47 - 02:19:49
And I got all dusty? 

02:19:49 - 02:19:51
And I must've passed out, because I woke up and you were gone. 

02:19:52 - 02:19:53
But Doctor Strange was there, right? And he was like... 

02:19:53 - 02:19:55
"It's been five years. Come on, they need us." 

02:19:55 - 02:19:57
And then he started doing the yellow sparkly thing that he does all the time. 

02:19:57 - 02:19:58
He did? Oh, no. 

02:19:58 - 02:19:59
What are you doing? 

02:20:04 - 02:20:06
This is nice. 

02:20:27 - 02:20:28
Gamora? 

02:20:38 - 02:20:40
I thought I lost you. 

02:20:44 - 02:20:47
Don't touch me! 

02:20:50 - 02:20:52
You missed the first time. 

02:20:52 - 02:20:54
Then you got 'em both the second time. 

02:20:56 - 02:20:57
This is the one? 

02:20:57 - 02:20:58
Seriously? 

02:20:59 - 02:21:01
Your choices were him or a tree. 

02:21:11 - 02:21:12
Cap! 

02:21:12 - 02:21:14
What do you want me to do with this damn thing? 

02:21:17 - 02:21:19
Get those stones as far away as possible! 

02:21:19 - 02:21:20
No! 

02:21:21 - 02:21:23
We need to get 'em back where they came from. 

02:21:23 - 02:21:26
No way to get 'em back. Thanos destroyed the quantum tunnel. 

02:21:26 - 02:21:27
Hold on! 

02:21:29 - 02:21:31
That wasn't our only time machine. 

02:21:37 - 02:21:39
Anyone see an ugly brown van out there? 

02:21:40 - 02:21:43
Yes! But you're not gonna like where it's parked! 

02:21:43 - 02:21:45
Scott, how long you need to get that thing working? 

02:21:46 - 02:21:47
Maybe 10 minutes. 

02:21:47 - 02:21:49
Get it started. We'll get the stones to you. 

02:21:49 - 02:21:51
We're on it, Cap. 

02:22:00 - 02:22:02
Hey. 

02:22:02 - 02:22:05
You said one out of 14 million, we win, yeah? 

02:22:06 - 02:22:07
Tell me this is it. 

02:22:07 - 02:22:09
If I tell you what happens... 

02:22:09 - 02:22:10
it won't happen. 

02:22:14 - 02:22:15
You better be right. 

02:22:23 - 02:22:25
It's a mess back here. 

02:22:26 - 02:22:27
It's dead. 

02:22:28 - 02:22:29
What?
It's dead.

02:22:30 - 02:22:31
I have to hot-wire it. 

02:22:34 - 02:22:35
Where's Nebula? 

02:22:36 - 02:22:38
She's not responding. 

02:22:38 - 02:22:40
Sire... 

02:22:49 - 02:22:51
Clint! 

02:22:53 - 02:22:54
Give it to me. 

02:23:16 - 02:23:19
You took everything from me. 

02:23:20 - 02:23:22
I don't even know who you are. 

02:23:22 - 02:23:24
You will. 

02:23:46 - 02:23:47
I got it! 

02:23:50 - 02:23:51
Activate Instant Kill. 

02:24:14 - 02:24:16
Rain fire! 

02:24:16 - 02:24:18
But, sire, our troops! 

02:24:18 - 02:24:20
Just do it! 

02:24:40 - 02:24:43
Is anyone else seeing this? 

02:24:57 - 02:24:58
I got this! 

02:24:58 - 02:25:00
I got this. Okay, I don't got this. 

02:25:00 - 02:25:01
Help, somebody help! 

02:25:01 - 02:25:03
Hey, Queens, heads up! 

02:25:13 - 02:25:14
Hang on. I got you, kid. 

02:25:18 - 02:25:19
Hey! Nice to meet you... 

02:25:19 - 02:25:21
Oh, my God! 

02:25:58 - 02:25:59
What the hell is this? 

02:26:00 - 02:26:01
Friday, what are they firing at? 

02:26:01 - 02:26:03
Something just entered the upper atmosphere. 

02:26:16 - 02:26:18
Oh, yeah! 

02:26:38 - 02:26:41
Danvers, we need an assist here. 

02:26:49 - 02:26:52
Hi, I'm Peter Parker. 

02:26:53 - 02:26:54
Hey, Peter Parker. 

02:26:54 - 02:26:55
You got something for me? 

02:27:01 - 02:27:04
I don't know how you're gonna get it through all of that. 

02:27:05 - 02:27:07
Don't worry. 

02:27:08 - 02:27:09
She's got help. 

02:29:57 - 02:30:00
I am inevitable. 

02:30:21 - 02:30:22
And I... 

02:30:24 - 02:30:25
am... 

02:30:29 - 02:30:30
Iron Man. 

02:32:29 - 02:32:31
Mr. Stark? 

02:32:31 - 02:32:32
Hey! 

02:32:33 - 02:32:36
Mr. Stark. Can you hear me? 

02:32:36 - 02:32:38
It's Peter. 

02:32:39 - 02:32:41
Hey. 

02:32:42 - 02:32:45
We won, Mr. Stark. 

02:32:47 - 02:32:49
We won, Mr. Stark. 

02:32:51 - 02:32:53
We won! You did it, sir, you did it. 

02:32:54 - 02:32:56
I'm sorry. 

02:32:56 - 02:32:57
Tony. 

02:33:10 - 02:33:11
Hey. 

02:33:12 - 02:33:13
Hey, Pep. 

02:33:18 - 02:33:19
Friday? 

02:33:19 - 02:33:22
Life functions critical. 

02:33:30 - 02:33:31
Tony? 

02:33:33 - 02:33:34
Look at me. 

02:33:36 - 02:33:38
We're gonna be okay. 

02:33:43 - 02:33:45
You can rest now. 

02:35:30 - 02:35:33
Everybody wants a happy ending, right? 

02:35:33 - 02:35:36
But it doesn't always roll that way. 

02:35:38 - 02:35:39
Maybe this time. 

02:35:41 - 02:35:44
I'm hoping if you play this back... 

02:35:45 - 02:35:47
it's in celebration. 

02:35:48 - 02:35:52
I hope families are reunited. I hope we get it back. 

02:35:52 - 02:35:56
And something like a normal version of the planet has been restored. 

02:35:56 - 02:35:58
If there ever was such a thing. 

02:35:58 - 02:36:01
God, what a world. Universe, now. 

02:36:02 - 02:36:04
If you told me 10 years ago that we weren't alone... 

02:36:04 - 02:36:08
let alone to this extent, I mean, I wouldn't have been surprised... 

02:36:08 - 02:36:10
but come on, who knew? 

02:36:10 - 02:36:15
The epic forces of darkness and light that have come into play. 

02:36:15 - 02:36:17
And for better or worse... 

02:36:17 - 02:36:21
that's the reality Morgan's gonna have to find a way to grow up in. 

02:36:24 - 02:36:26
So, I thought I'd probably better record a little greeting... 

02:36:26 - 02:36:30
in the case of an untimely death. On my part. 

02:36:30 - 02:36:33
Not that death at any time isn't untimely. 

02:36:34 - 02:36:37
This time travel thing that we're gonna try and pull off tomorrow... 

02:36:38 - 02:36:40
it's got me scratching my head about the survivability of it all. 

02:36:40 - 02:36:41
That's the thing. 

02:36:43 - 02:36:45
Then again, that's the hero gig, right? 

02:36:45 - 02:36:47
Part of the journey is the end. 

02:36:49 - 02:36:50
What am I even tripping for? 

02:36:50 - 02:36:54
Everything is gonna work out exactly the way it's supposed to. 

02:36:57 - 02:36:59
I love you 3,000. 

02:39:14 - 02:39:18
You know, I wish there was a way that I could let her know. 

02:39:20 - 02:39:22
That we won. 

02:39:24 - 02:39:25
We did it. 

02:39:29 - 02:39:31
She knows. 

02:39:36 - 02:39:38
They both do. 

02:39:47 - 02:39:48
How you doing, squirt? 

02:39:48 - 02:39:49
Good. 

02:39:49 - 02:39:50
You good?
Mm-hmm.

02:39:51 - 02:39:53
Good. You hungry?
Mm-hmm.

02:39:54 - 02:39:55
What do you want? 

02:39:55 - 02:39:57
Cheeseburgers. 

02:40:02 - 02:40:04
You know, your dad liked cheeseburgers. 

02:40:04 - 02:40:06
Okay. 

02:40:08 - 02:40:10
I'm gonna get you all the cheeseburgers you want. 

02:40:11 - 02:40:12
Okay. 

02:40:28 - 02:40:30
So... 

02:40:30 - 02:40:32
when can we expect you back? 

02:40:34 - 02:40:36
About that... 

02:40:36 - 02:40:38
Thor, your people need a king. 

02:40:38 - 02:40:40
No, they already have one. 

02:40:42 - 02:40:43
That's funny. 

02:40:49 - 02:40:51
Are you being serious? 

02:40:54 - 02:40:56
It's time for me to be who I am... 

02:40:57 - 02:41:00
rather than who I'm supposed to be. 

02:41:01 - 02:41:03
But you, you're a leader. 

02:41:03 - 02:41:05
That's who you are. 

02:41:08 - 02:41:10
You know, I'd make a lot of changes around here. 

02:41:10 - 02:41:11
I'm counting on it... 

02:41:11 - 02:41:13
Your Majesty. 

02:41:23 - 02:41:24
What will you do? 

02:41:25 - 02:41:26
I'm not sure. 

02:41:27 - 02:41:30
For the first time in a thousand years, I have no path. 

02:41:30 - 02:41:32
I do have a ride though. 

02:41:32 - 02:41:34
Move it or lose it, hairbag. 

02:41:38 - 02:41:40
Here we are! 

02:41:40 - 02:41:42
Tree, good to see you. 

02:41:46 - 02:41:50
The Asgardians of the Galaxy back together again. 

02:41:50 - 02:41:52
Where to first? 

02:41:53 - 02:41:54
Hey. 

02:41:55 - 02:41:57
Just so you know, this is my ship still. 

02:41:57 - 02:41:58
I'm in charge. 

02:41:58 - 02:42:01
I know. I know. Of course you are. 

02:42:01 - 02:42:03
Of course. 

02:42:05 - 02:42:08
See, you say, "Of course," but then you touch the map. 

02:42:08 - 02:42:11
It makes you think that maybe you didn't realize I was in charge. 

02:42:11 - 02:42:13
Quail, that's your own insecurities in there. 

02:42:13 - 02:42:14
Quail? 

02:42:14 - 02:42:16
Okay? I am merely trying to be of service and assisting. 

02:42:16 - 02:42:17
Quill. 

02:42:18 - 02:42:19
That's what I said. 

02:42:19 - 02:42:21
You should fight one another for the honor of leadership. 

02:42:21 - 02:42:23
Sounds fair. 

02:42:25 - 02:42:28
It's not necessary, okay?
It's not.

02:42:28 - 02:42:30
I got some blasters, unless you guys wanna use knives. 

02:42:30 - 02:42:33
Oh, yes! Please, use knives. 

02:42:33 - 02:42:34
Yeah. Knives. 

02:42:34 - 02:42:36
I am Groot. 

02:42:41 - 02:42:43
Not necessary. 

02:42:43 - 02:42:44
There shall be no knifing one another. 

02:42:45 - 02:42:48
Everybody knows who's in charge. 

02:42:51 - 02:42:52
Me. 

02:42:53 - 02:42:54
Right? 

02:42:55 - 02:42:57
Yes, you. 

02:42:58 - 02:43:00
Of course! Of course. 

02:43:00 - 02:43:02
Of course. 

02:43:04 - 02:43:05
Remember... 

02:43:06 - 02:43:08
you have to return the stones to the exact moment you got 'em... 

02:43:08 - 02:43:12
or you're gonna open up a bunch of nasty alternative realities. 

02:43:12 - 02:43:13
Don't worry, Bruce. 

02:43:13 - 02:43:15
Clip all the branches. 

02:43:16 - 02:43:18
You know, I tried. 

02:43:19 - 02:43:23
When I had the gauntlet, the stones, I really tried to bring her back. 

02:43:26 - 02:43:28
I miss her, man. 

02:43:28 - 02:43:29
Me too. 

02:43:33 - 02:43:36
You know, if you want, I could come with you. 

02:43:38 - 02:43:40
You're a good man, Sam. 

02:43:40 - 02:43:42
This one's on me, though. 

02:43:46 - 02:43:48
Don't do anything stupid till I get back. 

02:43:50 - 02:43:51
How can I? 

02:43:52 - 02:43:53
You're taking all the stupid with you. 

02:44:01 - 02:44:03
Gonna miss you, buddy. 

02:44:03 - 02:44:05
It's gonna be okay, Buck. 

02:44:12 - 02:44:14
How long is this gonna take? 

02:44:14 - 02:44:17
For him, as long as he needs. For us, five seconds. 

02:44:22 - 02:44:23
You ready, Cap? 

02:44:23 - 02:44:26
All right, we'll meet you back here, okay? 

02:44:26 - 02:44:28
You bet. 

02:44:29 - 02:44:31
Going quantum. Three... 

02:44:31 - 02:44:32
two... 

02:44:33 - 02:44:34
one. 

02:44:36 - 02:44:38
And returning in five... 

02:44:38 - 02:44:39
four... 

02:44:39 - 02:44:41
three, two... 

02:44:41 - 02:44:43
one. 

02:44:50 - 02:44:51
Where is he? 

02:44:51 - 02:44:53
I don't know. He blew right by his time stamp. 

02:44:53 - 02:44:54
He should be here. 

02:45:00 - 02:45:01
Get him back. 

02:45:01 - 02:45:02
I'm trying.
Get him the hell back.

02:45:02 - 02:45:04
Hey, I said I'm trying.
Sam.

02:45:28 - 02:45:30
Go ahead. 

02:45:48 - 02:45:49
Cap? 

02:45:51 - 02:45:52
Hi, Sam. 

02:45:55 - 02:45:59
So, did something go wrong or did something go right? 

02:46:01 - 02:46:05
Well, after I put the stones back, I thought... 

02:46:06 - 02:46:07
maybe... 

02:46:07 - 02:46:12
I'll try some of that life Tony was telling me to get. 

02:46:14 - 02:46:16
How'd that work out for ya? 

02:46:19 - 02:46:20
It was beautiful. 

02:46:22 - 02:46:23
Good. I'm happy for you. 

02:46:24 - 02:46:25
Truly. 

02:46:25 - 02:46:27
Thank you. 

02:46:28 - 02:46:29
Only thing bumming me out... 

02:46:29 - 02:46:33
is the fact I have to live in a world without Captain America. 

02:46:37 - 02:46:40
That reminds me. 

02:46:48 - 02:46:49
Try it on. 

02:47:15 - 02:47:16
How does it feel? 

02:47:19 - 02:47:21
Like it's someone else's. 

02:47:24 - 02:47:25
It isn't. 

02:47:38 - 02:47:40
Thank you. 

02:47:41 - 02:47:43
I'll do my best. 

02:47:48 - 02:47:50
That's why it's yours. 

02:47:52 - 02:47:53
You wanna tell me about her? 

02:48:00 - 02:48:01
No. 

02:48:02 - 02:48:04
No, I don't think I will.
